1. God's Mercy (5)

Shirone clenched his teeth. There was nothing else he could do.

He thought he could cast magic, but if he teleported in this state, his body would be shattered.

'Damn it! I have to move somehow.'

If time passed like this, Kanya's mother would die.

No, everyone would die. The only thing left in the end was a hideous giant whose name he couldn't even know.

"Give up, foolish humans. No one can interfere with Ra's law."

Igirin looked at the scene of everyone kneeling with satisfaction.

This is authority. Obedience is not forced, but voluntary.

"Damn, why is it so heavy?"

A sound came from behind the statue, and Igirin's face hardened.

Then he heard a sound of footsteps. Everyone looked there as if a ghost had appeared.

Tes shouted with a flush.

"Lian!"

Lian moved his steps with a grimace.

His body weight seemed to be a ton.

Still, the reason he didn't get crushed was because the load was distributed throughout his body.

"What did you do to me? My body is so heavy."

"How can you move...?"

It wasn't magic that could be endured by simply being strong. The load was proportional to the muscle mass, so the stronger the strength, the heavier the body state.

If he moved, there was only one possible case. He had to exert more strength than he could.

Of course, that was not normal for a human either.

'He exerts more than physical strength? No, that can't be. It's the top ability among the giant's magic.'

Igirin was lost in thought while a dull sound came from where Shirone and his party were.

"Hehehe, very funny magic. That's why fighting is fun."

Habist popped out of Canis' shadow.

Shirone realized after seeing Lian and Habist's cases.

It was not an absolute load, but a relative load that was applied. The countermeasures were different because the activation principles were different, so it was important information.

"Shall we catch you?"

Habist rushed to Igirin. But the fairy chief's flying ability was not to be underestimated.

They were momentarily distracted by the chase that looked like a fight, and Shirone shouted at Lian.

"Lian! There's no time! We have to break the statue!"

Lian lifted his greatsword in front of the statue, and Igirin's face was shocked in flight.

He could dismiss the shadow chasing him as not human, but the swordsman was made of flesh and blood.

To swing a greatsword under the influence of irregularity, he had to have near 100 percent control over his body.

Lian roared and hit the statue, and there was a bang.

The believers were startled, but the statue didn't even crack.

Lian clenched his teeth.

He wanted to smash everything as it came, but all he could do in this situation was to hit it again.

'Damn it! If it wasn't for this weird magic!'

The liquid in the bead had risen to half. The subjects seemed resigned and closed their eyes.

From their point of view, Lian would be hateful. If they hadn't been disturbed, everything would have been comfortable by now.

Arin spoke through the mental channel.

-We have to find a way. It doesn't fit with equivalent exchange to restrict hundreds of people's movements with just one spell. There must be some condition we don't know.

Shirone thought the same thing.

Irregularity was something that happened within zero-sum of equivalent exchange no matter how outrageous it was.

There had to be a way to release it from being restrained by the intensity of the ability.

Shirone recalled Marsha's advice.

Irregularity has a deep relationship with the caster's personality.

Igirin is an authority fairy. Therefore, there was a high possibility that it was related to authority in some way.

"Impossible! You are lying! The Law of Lae is absolute! The chosen ones will return to their original bodies after their lifespan is over!"

Igirin shouted, his voice trembling with anger and fear. He could not accept the possibility that his authority was based on a lie. He had devoted his life to serving Lae, the god of light, and enforcing his law on the people.

He glared at Shiro, who was still holding his sword against the statue of the giant. He was one of the heretics who had rejected Lae's law and sought to expose the truth behind the ritual of Ilhwa.

Ilhwa was a magic that Igirin claimed to be a gift from Lae. It was supposed to regenerate the bodies of the chosen ones, who were selected by Lae every year to serve as his messengers. They were given a new body that was stronger, faster, and more beautiful than their original one. They also received a mark on their forehead that signified their status as Lae's chosen ones.

However, Shiro and his companions had discovered that Ilhwa was not a blessing, but a curse. It was a magic that drained the life force of the chosen ones and transferred it to Igirin, who used it to enhance his own power and influence. The chosen ones did not return to their original bodies after their lifespan was over. They were simply discarded like trash, without any funeral or respect.

Shiro had witnessed this himself when he found the corpse of his sister, who had been one of the chosen ones. She had died in agony, her body shriveled and decayed. He had sworn to expose Igirin's deception and free the people from his tyranny.

He smiled bitterly at Igirin's denial. He knew that it was useless to reason with him or his followers. They were too brainwashed by Igirin's lies and propaganda. They would rather die than question their faith.

"That's why you are afraid, Igirin. You know that your power is fading. You know that more and more people are doubting you. You know that your time is up."

He raised his sword and swung it at the statue again, causing another crack to appear on its surface.

"Everyone! Look at this statue! This is not a symbol of Lae's glory! This is a symbol of Igirin's greed! He has been stealing your lives for his own benefit! He has been lying to you for years! He has been killing you in the name of Lae!"

He shouted, hoping to reach the hearts of some of the people who were watching him. He knew that he was risking his life by doing this, but he did not care. He had nothing to lose. He had already lost everything he loved.

He only wanted to expose the truth and end Igirin's reign of terror.

- Shirone didn't flinch at their words. She knew she had no choice but to say what she had to say.

"Listen to me! There is something more important than your lifespan! Your name! Your identity! Don't you want to know who you really are?"

The crowd became silent for a moment. They had never thought about their names before. They only knew their numbers and their roles assigned
