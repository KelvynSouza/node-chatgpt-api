[665] Insufficient Five Senses (4)

Through the Ultima system, Shirone, who interpreted Mayrei's language, felt a creepy chill.

It wasn't pointing to a specific person, but it felt as if La Enemy was whispering to herself.

'My hell.'

La Enemy is waiting there.

There is room for interpretation, but it was key information to pass the test of the Ivory Tower.

"What is the ability of the divine frequency?"

"The Teraphos that the Galron Kingdom believes in is the conqueror of numerous universes. According to the doctrine, it came from a place much farther than the universe we live in."

The reason it cannot be dismissed as a myth is because Shirone has actually been to heaven.

'Could it be Gaia?'

It wasn't unreasonable to think so, but she immediately shook her head.

'No, it can't be them.'

Gaia has already left the photon system, and the departure of the last remaining Gepin ended the history of the race.

"The trust of Teraphos is realized through dreams. I also received trust from the age of seven."

Mayrei explained with gestures.

"The place where you receive trust in your dreams is always the same. It's a dark place. You can't see anything. Then a vertical light opens, and there is a silhouette of God in it."

Mayrei put down her hand.

"When you wake up from your dream, most of your memories disappear and only a few simple pieces of information come to mind. When the priest conveys that information, the people of Teraphos follow it."

"But it's still a dream, right? How do you prove that it's true?"

"Religion is not a realm of proof. In fact, in Galron, heretics who refuse to trust are plotting a revolution. The power of the papacy is strong, so it's not a threat. Anyway, the problem starts now."

Mayrei drew everyone's attention again.

"The reason I became a heretic and left Galron is because my ability exceeded the authority of the Pope. I felt like I was going to receive trust while falling asleep as usual. As expected, that space appeared in my dream. And when the door of light opened......"

Mayrei spoke with a serious expression.

"I woke up from my dream."

"You woke up... from your dream?"

"Maybe that could be a dream too, but all my nerves definitely told me it was reality. That's when I realized that the dreams I thought were trust were actually all reality."

Shirone swallowed her saliva.

"The door of light opened wide and they approached. I don't remember what they looked like, and all I have is a blurry image. They looked at me closely and had a strange signal conversation. I didn't know at the time, but I know now. It probably meant, 'This is a bit peculiar. Why is it waking up?'"

Mayrei's voice began to tremble.

"They tried a lot on me. I screamed in fear, and then I lost consciousness. When I regained consciousness, I was lying in a place like an operating table. When I screamed to save me, they said this again. Really peculiar, huh? Why does it wake up?"

Mayrei regained her calm expression.

"And then I woke up from my sleep. But by then, I already knew the reality."

"It could really be a dream, right?"

Mayrei shook her head and lifted her hair above her earlobe.

There was a scar from the incision in the place where the hair did not grow.

"I checked it as soon as I woke up from my dream. I don't know what they did to me, but they probably implanted something."

Mayrei covered both ears with her hands.

"That's the ability I've had since then. When I block my hearing, I can collect sounds of a specific frequency."

That was the identity of Mayrei's irregularity, the divine frequency.

"In fact, you can't completely block the sound just by blocking your ears, so there's a little noise mixed in. I think if I cut off my ears, I can hear more clearly, but Luphyst opposed it because it makes communication with others difficult."

Shirone also thought it was a waste to remove her ears and give up the advantages of communication.

"Did Mr. Lupist tell you about me?"

"He helped me escape from Galon to Tormia. He said that if I join forces with Mr. Siron, it might be possible to remove La Enemy. Maybe the reason I have this ability is because of the design of Teraphos."

The next conversation seemed better to share with Lupist.

"Understood. You've worked hard."

Since Meirei knew that she was going to pass anyway, she left the evaluation site without saying anything else.

Aria took off her glasses and said,

"It's a really absurd story. Both La Enemy and Teraphos."

These were pieces of information that ordinary people didn't even have a chance to access.

"But it's reality. If we can't stop it, a crisis will come to where we live."

Aria, as a bureaucrat of Tormia, was also aware of the seriousness of the matter.

"Okay. It seems there will be no problem in forming a mercenary group. Let's notify the applicants individually and have a meeting in the evening."

* * *

That night.

The core members gathered in Siron's room.

With Lian and Aria attending, Etela, Kuan, and Meirei came in one after another.

Finally, the applicants number 28 and 29 came in, took off their masks, and of course, no one was surprised.

"You've put together quite well. The list of passers."

First, Lupist, who praised Siron, explained.

"You probably know roughly, but there are two main points of this mission. First, closing Radum. Second, understanding the intentions of La Enemy and removing it if possible."

Etela raised her hand and asked,

"Where is Shagal?"

"He is being searched by the association, but his identity is not confirmed. He either left the kingdom or is in Radum, one of the two."

"He must be in Radum."

Shagal was a person corresponding to the post-smell of the Great Purification.

If he had followed the traces of La Enemy and flowed into Tormia, his destination was already determined.

"I will take care of Shagal. There's something I want to check."

Etela didn't use the word revenge, even though she might have to kill him.

"I allow it. But he's a guy worth using. You know what I mean without saying it."

"There's something I'm curious about."

Siron asked.

"You said you would remove it if possible, but how?"

"I'll explain from now on."

Lupist moved his seat to a place where everyone could see.

"We are protecting the body of Benecia, the leader of the Spectrum. According to her, La seems to exert influence on the organization of Radum by controlling the past. Therefore, even the kingdom decided to close it at the risk of danger."

So far, it was understandable.

"So how do we find La? First of all, La only exists in the past events. Siron, what is your definition of the past?"

"Um, isn't it before a specific event?"

"That's not wrong either. But I want to define it a little more specifically. The past is the memory of the senses."

"Ah."

"All the things we experience are reconstructed through the senses and recorded in the brain. Therefore, the way La Enemy controls the past can't be extended beyond the senses either."

"Because it's beyond human limits."

Lupist nodded.

"Yes, then what if you can feel the senses of the past as reality? That's reality. Time is also just one way the human brain perceives the world."

That's why time-space explosion magic is possible.

"Benecia pointed out this part with the ability of the three brains. In conclusion, the past can also be reality depending on the way of perception. So La is not a ghost without substance. Just the past."

Lupist raised his index finger.

"Just exist in the past. Siron, La might have been in this room a while ago. Do you agree?"

"Yes."

"So why can't we be sure?"

"Because there is no memory of the senses."

"That's right. Because it doesn't exist in the present, or rather because it's not recognized in the present, we think it doesn't exist."

Lupist picked up the cup on the table.

"What do you think if humans are not as they are now, but are actually just brains submerged in a special liquid?"

Shirone imagined it.

"Whether it's true or not isn't important. The point is, even if it is, we have no way of realizing that fact. What the brain feels is everything. Then, does this cup really exist, or is it just a delusion of the brain?"

No one could answer.

"It's meaningless to distinguish between existence and non-existence when dealing with Ra. If we can feel Ra with our five senses, it actually exists for us."

'So that's it. To find Ra is......'

Shirone realized the intention of the problem posed by the Ivory Tower.

-Can you prove existence and non-existence?

This was the problem that the candidate of the stars had to solve.

Kuan asked.

"Pull out the memory of the five senses and kill Ra. The idea is good, but how do you pull it out into reality?"

"Jane."

When Lupist reached out his hand, Jane handed him a box.

"What I'm holding now is an objet specially procured with the kingdom's finances. There's a hint about Ra's ability in this box."

Lian, who had been dumbfounded like a fool until now, showed interest for the first time.

"What kind of objet?"

"&lt;Nemesis&gt;."

The moment Lupist's words fell, Shirone slapped his knee.

"Ah, &lt;Nemesis&gt;!"

It was an A-class objet that he had heard from Woorin when he went to the Kazra Kingdom due to the paternity test uproar.

"It seems you know. It's quite famous in this line. If you come into contact with Nemesis, the user's imagination is implemented into reality within a radius of 20 meters."

It was one of the objets whose owner changed several times due to being eaten by human greed.

"How the imagined thing becomes reality is no longer necessary to explain. Anyway, the association speculates that Ra's ability is similar to the mechanism of &lt;Nemesis&gt;."

Etela said.

"So you're using Ra's ability in reverse. But isn't the reality implementation ability of &lt;Nemesis&gt; limited to the contact object?"

"That's why I crushed it."

When Lupist opened the box, eight rings with a smooth, pinkish material like jade came out.

Shirone pointed at the ring with an interested expression.

"Is that... &lt;Nemesis&gt;?"

"Yes. When I first got this, I was curious about what would happen if two people touched &lt;Nemesis&gt; at the same time. The result of the experiment is that the imagination is shared. Because what the senses feel is reality."

Lupist picked up one of the rings.

"Also, it seems that the ability of &lt;Nemesis&gt; is determined by the content of a special ingredient contained in the ore. The reason why I processed it into a ring shape by throwing away 9/10 of the total weight is because of its good portability and possession. Control your mind after wearing the ring. Of course, only those who think they can do so are gathered here. I will take back the item when the mission is over."

Kuan said.

"I understand that you pull Ra into reality with Meirei's ability. But the senses are too lacking. Leaving aside tracking by relying solely on the ears, how on earth do you cut Ra?"

Shirone muttered as if he had suddenly thought of something.

"Sibulsangpokmae?"

With everyone's attention focused, Lupist turned to Shirone and said.

"Yes, that's right."

Shirone's Sibulsangpokmae was a sense of touch that could touch Ra Enemy because it could perceive the past as the present.

"When Meirei finds it, you kill it."
