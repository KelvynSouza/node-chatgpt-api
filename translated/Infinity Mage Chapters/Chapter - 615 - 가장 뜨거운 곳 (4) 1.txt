[615] The Hottest Place (4)

Arian Shirone.

A name already engraved in the minds of the students shone brightly.

He had been featured in Spirit magazine without fail since he defeated Dante in the 2000th battle.

It was a hot topic in schools nationwide when such a promising student suddenly gave up on the graduation class evaluation.

"Why so? What happened?"

Iruki and Nade approached Shirone's question.

"Where have you been? We've been waiting all day."

"Sorry. I was called by the chairman and just had a meeting. Because he came late......"

"The chairman?"

The students began to murmur.

Does that mean he had a one-on-one meeting with the chairman until now?

It was not a good feeling to know that only Shirone was called out among the 150 people gathered.

But as Elizabeth said, there was no future as a wizard if you thought of meeting the chairman as a privilege.

"Why did the chairman call you?"

Curtis approached on behalf of the students.

His eyes were full of dissatisfaction, and there was no trace of the relaxed expression he had just a while ago.

"Why should I tell you that?"

It was a very personal issue, and there was no need to feel guilty as he had already rejected the chairman's proposal.

"Huh, when did Alpheus Magic School become so arrogant? Do you trust the principal teacher and act up?"

Upon hearing Curtis's words, Shirone was finally able to grasp the atmosphere of the venue.

"Let's not fight, anyway. It's not good to lose energy when we all have important exams ahead."

It was a good point, but it was a loss for the Royal Magic School, which had already been upset.

-Announce to the students.

Rufist's voice was heard from the ceiling.

'It's started.'

The broadcast continued with Fermiman's meaningful smile.

-I am proud as a chairman to see you, who will bear the future of the kingdom, getting along well.

The students checked the video recorders installed around them.

They knew it was installed for security, but they never dreamed that the chairman would be watching.

'Is he proud even though?'

It meant that he had anticipated the students' clash.

-In that sense, I have prepared a special event.

The students waited for the next words with tense expressions.

-There is a certified wizard's certificate hidden in the place where you are.

Dozens of eyes swept around.

-Of course, the name is not written. So it means that the person who has it is the owner.

Shirone's eyes became fierce.

It was a fact known only to Shirone, who had had a meeting, that it was not an event prepared from the beginning.

'It's an event targeting me.'

-From the moment the person who obtained the certified certificate goes to the registration office on the 7th floor of the association, that student is a certified wizard and a staff member of the Magic Association.

"Magic Association staff?"

It was too much to call it an event.

-Then have a good time. That's it.

With the feeling of wanting to dig the floor and find the certificate right away, and the thought of whether it was necessary to be so miserable, someone spoke.

"Well, let's just enjoy the party. There's no need to look for it with fire in your eyes."

"Right. It's just an event where the person who stumbles upon it gets lucky. It's like a simple event. Like a prize draw."

It didn't seem like a big deal if you thought about it, but all that was left in their heads was the word certified wizard's certificate.

As expected, when the students scattered around, Iruki hit Shirone's side and said.

"What the hell happened? You can tell us, can't you?"

"It's just as you think. This event now, actually, it was proposed to me. But I refused."

"Hmm. Is it annoying or considerate? It's quite complicated."

Nade asked.

"What should we do? Even if the other kids pretend not to, they're already searching around. Should we look for it too?"

"It's up to each person's judgment. But I won't do it."

"The magician that Shirone dreamed of was not like that.

“Let's watch for now. They must have made it hard to find.”

So the atmosphere of the strange event ripened.

There were few students who were openly looking for it, but it was common to see students pretending to enjoy the feast while lifting plates or pretending to pick something up and searching under the table.

‘It's not there. Where is it?’

Even if the annex was wide, there were many people, so the visible places were confirmed in an instant.

“I can't find it after all.”

Iruki said.

“If this event was not planned, it means that they hid the certificate after the students came in. Then we can raise two possibilities. First, they hid it with magic. Second, they hid it through subcontractors.”

The students around him were surprised and hovered within a certain distance.

It was not a Nade that could not be noticed, but he did not care.

“You, a servant, can remember all the movements of the subcontractors.”

The number of staff currently helping the party was 23.

“There are no staff members who have shown behavior that can hide something in memory. Of course, I can't confirm what moved in the blind spot.”

“Maybe the staff have it?”

“I can't deny that possibility.”

‘It's the staff!’

The students scattered and talked to the subcontractors.

“Do you have a certificate? Or something handed over. Tell me honestly!”

The staff shook their heads with a bewildered expression, but the students' questioning was persistent.

“Don't do that and give me a hint! Is it a password? Do you just have to say the keyword?”

Iruki, who was watching their noise, said.

“This chairman of the association is not normal either.”

If there is one thing that can emotionally drive the best students in the country, it would be a wizard's certificate.

“They didn't entrust it to subcontractors. They hid it with magic.”

From then on, Shirone's voice became smaller, and Iruki and Nade also became aware of their surroundings.

“That's right. The staff never left the annex, and they were not replaced by anyone else.”

Nade asked.

“Wasn't there a blind spot?”

“Of course. I've been watching from the beginning to the end.”

If it's Iruki, it's still there.

“But how did they hide it with magic? The magic control device is activated.”

Shirone said.

“That's the hint. Rufist is testing us.”

“You bastard! Don't go away! This place is mine!”

“I came first!”

Eventually, a fist fight broke out.

“You bastard! You must have hit first!”

As it led to a collision between schools, the party quickly turned into a hell.

“Kukuku. Kukuku.”

Fermi, who was leaning against the wall and watching, tore his mouth.

“It's such a beautiful night.”

One who understands and uses the system.

“The certificate is mine!”

“Shut up! Anyway, the association is supposed to go in!”

A person swallowed by the system.

"Stop it."

Shirone clenched his fists.

"I said stop!"

A person who opposes the system.

-You don't even know who suggested red and blue.

And the meta-system that dominates that system.

'I have to stop it somehow.'

There was no longer any intention of Rufist in the minds of the fighters.

Shirone, who concentrated his mind to enter the Spirit Zone, shook his head.

'It doesn't work.'

The magic control device disrupts the concentration by bypassing some of the specific brain waves when a person concentrates.

That's why it was a strange situation where you couldn't enter the Spirit Zone even in a situation where you could think as much as you wanted.

In front of the technology that turns a wizard into an ordinary person, Shirone stared at the world with wide eyes.

'Direct hit!'

When the Ultima system was activated, the information of the magic control device was decomposed into the minimum unit and infiltrated.

'Wow......'

It felt like standing in the middle of a world where the melody of endless information vibrated like a jump rope.

Following the gap that changes in real time, Shirone finally reached the focus point at the end of letting consciousness flow.

"Everyone close your eyes!"

As the sphere of light above Shirone's head was compressed at a terrifying speed, the friends who had already experienced it closed their eyes tightly.

'Shining Impact!'

When a huge white light exploded with a flash, the scenery of the observatory was erased as if it had turned into a blur.

"Huh?"

When light spewed out from all the monitors illuminating the observatory, Rufist, who was holding his chin, raised the corners of his mouth.

"Gaia..."

As the light of the monitor went out simultaneously, the surprised expressions of the students were caught.

"What, what is it?"

The students who stopped fighting looked back at Shirone one by one.

"Stop it. What are we fighting for? We can get enough qualifications with our power."

Rational words gave shame to emotional people, and soon turned into anger through rationalization.

"What are you to tell us what to do? You must be a high guy."

"That's right! Do you think we're fighting for just a qualification? It's a chance to get into the association!"

Shirone spread his palm.

'Photon Cannon!'

When the photon containing mass was born and vibrated terribly, the faces of the students turned pale.

"How, how can magic?"

Those who confirmed that the magic control device is still operating had no choice but to be astonished.

"Could it be... bypassed?"

Curtis, the top of the Royal Magic School, muttered with a lost face.

It wasn't that he didn't try to fight, but it was absurd that a student would break through the security of the association.

'It's impossible! It's a trick. Otherwise...'

There can't be such a difference.

Shirone approached Curtis with the Photon Cannon floating.

"Move."

"Ugh!"

Curtis was overwhelmed for a moment, but he had no choice but to be a normal person now.

As Curtis slowly stepped back, Shirone's gaze fell down and pierced the floor below.

'It's here.'

Through the direct hit, he felt a box that someone had magically moved underneath.

'Break through the security measures suggested by the association.'

That was the minimum condition to obtain a public wizard's license.

'I'm annoyed by that!'

When Shirone gritted his teeth and plunged the Photon Cannon, the floor broke with a roar.

"He really destroyed it with light."

It was the moment when they saw the reality of the particle of God, which they had only encountered in magazines.

The space below the floor was empty, and Shirone, who put his hand in, opened the box and took out the certificate.

"Ah......"

The students looked at it with envy and desperate desire.

'I want it, a public wizard's license.'

It was also a license guaranteed to be appointed to the Magic Association.

'Rufist, this is my answer.'

Shirone, who held out his license to the video recording device, cast a multiple light explosion using Elysion.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
