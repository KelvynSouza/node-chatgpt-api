[578] Probability of R (1)

Alpheus Magic School Repair Factory.

This place, which repairs simple magic textbooks, is off-limits to students and even staff when night falls.

This is because of the risk of theft, loss, and fire.

And now, losses began to occur there due to Sabina's air cut.

As the sparks flew and the wire mesh split, Prings, who threw his body, shook his head.

"It can't be, it can't be."

Prings is strong.

The modifier of being the 3rd in the graduation class is just a comprehensive of numerous magic abilities.

In actual combat, the combat magician is a fierce position, and the attribute is freezing. In front of the ability to avoid sensually, even Sabina, who is also a combat magician, could not help but feel powerless.

"Huh!"

Prings, who grabbed Sabina's neck, slammed her into the bars.

"This is......!"

"Release the spirit zone."

It was a cold voice that pierced the heart.

"If not, your neck will fly off."

Sabina, who felt her esophagus piercing her neck freeze, released the spirit zone.

"Even if you do, the master card will never......"

"Shut up. I ask the questions."

The moment she saw Prings' eyes, her heart sank.

'It's cold.'

Every time the cold air blooming from his hand seeped into her nose, she felt like her intestines were being frozen.

"You won't last long. At most 10 minutes? If you keep breathing like this, your stomach will turn into an ice cube."

Sabina didn't know why he was giving her pain, ignoring the victory conditions of Scramble Royal.

"What do you want?"

Prings, who leaned his face towards Sabina, took a deep breath so she could hear it.

"Haahaaa!"

Looking at his trembling eyelids, she naturally felt murderous, but it was a strange nature that she didn't dare to reveal.

"You smell disgusting, Sabina. It feels like I've fallen into a slum."

At the same time as Sabina choked, the cold air intensified and she felt a pain as if her blood vessels were tearing.

"Huh!"

"What are you thinking? Waiting for Nade? Did you see the rescue signal earlier and think he would come?"

Sabina clenched her mouth tightly.

"Answer me. If not, I'll kill you."

Prings will definitely do it.

There was no law, morality, or dignity as a student of magic school in his expression without a mask.

"Yes......"

"Good, good girl. Now I'm going to ask you a question. If I think you're lying, I'll kill you. If you stall, you'll freeze to death. Now, step 1."

Sabina's lips trembled.

"Let's start with something easy. What did you eat this morning?"

"I ate bread."

"Tell me exactly! What kind of bread did you eat? How did it taste? Did you eat it with milk? Or juice?"

As the cold air intensified, Sabina gritted her teeth and shouted.

"I ate cream bread with milk! I thought it was so delicious! Why!"

"Oh, is that so? Cream bread with milk......"

Prings' eyes rolled back.

"......you ate. Very deliciously....... It must have been sweet, huh? It must have melted softly in your mouth?"

'I want to kill you!'

Prings' pupils returned to their place.

"Okay. Second question. When was your first kiss? Who did you do it with
[Translated block]


Sabina's pupils dilated.

"The effects are slowly showing. How about giving up? Do you want to die over this?"

Frost began to form on the iron fence of the repair factory.

'Hurry! Hurry!'

Nade tried his best to teleport.

As far as he knew, none of his teammates were the type to ask for help unless it was a serious matter.

'It seems to be Sabina's territory.'

The moment he tried to speed up the tempo of teleportation, monsters with horns on their foreheads attacked from all sides.

True Sky Magic - Red Goblin.

When he reflexively laid down plasma and struck lightning, the goblin's body exploded with blue electricity tangled around it.

'It's a trap! I have to hang Kang...'

Nade's current hand was ○●○●(Democracy), and the trap's hand was ○●ⓡ●.

'He chose the last card as black. Then the random card is likely to be white.'

It was advantageous to hang Kang if the cards were the same.

"Trap, Kang."

The trap answered.

"Kang."

It was indeed the same democracy, and it was a strange situation for the trap to surprise him.

'Why did he surprise me when my cards are already public? Why did he surprise me knowing that we have the same cards?'

It wasn't even a place with a scramble.

"Did you come to block the structure? You suggested a secret consultation yesterday. You have a bat-like personality."

The trap bowed politely.

"Thank you."

'What, really? This woman...'

The trap continued.

"But I'm in the middle of my own battle. I don't care about Scramble Royal."

"Then move aside. I'm busy as it is."

"Nade, who are you?"

Nade kept his mouth shut.

"I've been trained to analyze humans since I was born. It's a cold analysis like a machine."

"So what? Are you curious about how to be the last in the graduation class?"

"There are clearly those who are stronger than me and those who are weaker. Of course, most of them are weak. But you..."

Before making a definitive statement, the trap squinted at Nade one last time.

"I really don't know. So I felt the need to check now, facing a major event."

Nade opened his mouth, remembering Sabina's words.

"I'm me. I don't know what you want to know, but nothing will change now."

"Really?"

The trap waved her hand.

True Sky Magic - Image Implementation(Self-portrait).

"Now, your real appearance...!"

The trap's eyes bulged as she stopped speaking.

'What is that?'

"Krrrrrr!"

Electricity flickered from Nade's body and exploded outwards.

"Uaaaaaaa!"

The scenery flickered as if day and night were repeating, and the moment the entity was revealed, the trap's body shot up in a flash.

'I can't read it.'

It was an ability to implement the opponent's image as an image, but even the trap, who was the price of illusion, could not analyze it.

"Could it be...?"

Peeeeeeong!

The real lightning, not an illusion, spread out, completely destroying the radius where Nade was.

The trap, who landed precisely on a branch 200 meters away, looked at Nade running away into the forest with a self-portrait.

"How could it get to that point..."

What was revealed through image implementation was an incomprehensible mystery.

"How can you not go crazy?"

* * *

"Haaaaa..."

Cold steam seeped out between Sabina's lips.

Her mind was slowly becoming hazy and her body felt frozen, her senses disappearing.

"The end is near. What does it feel like to die?"

'I have to tell.'

It's better than dying.

'I can't tell.'

I'd rather die.

That ambiguous boundary where Sabina was conflicted was exactly where Prings felt pleasure.

"Now, it's your last chance. Choose. Will you answer, or will you die?"

"I am..."

Just as Sabina's mouth opened, Prings' expression hardened.

'Spirit Zone?'

At the same time as he flew his body, a flash of light passed where he had been.

"Krrrrrr!"

Electricity flickered from Nade's body and exploded outwards.

"Uaaaaaaa!"

The scenery flickered as if day and night were repeating, and the moment the entity was revealed, the trap's body shot up in a flash.

"Ugh!"

Sabina, who had knelt down, gasping for breath, turned her head with a pained expression.

"Nade?"

Unexpectedly, it was Shiro who stood there, but before she could feel disappointed, she staggered towards him.

"I'm sorry. It's too much for me."

Shiro knew best about Pring's abilities, having faced him directly.

"Are you okay? Are you hurt?"

"I'm not in good shape. I don't know exactly, but I won't die."

Shiro frowned and glared at Pring.

"What are you doing now?"

"I don't know what you mean. What are you doing?"

"No matter how intense the emotions are, it's a game based on rules and agreements. I can't tolerate tormenting the opponent like this."

Pring mimicked Shiro's words in a baby voice.

"I can't tolerate tormenting the opponent."

And he approached the blushing Shiro and said,

"If you can't tolerate it, what are you going to do? Are you going to hit me? Then run away like crazy."

Pring's index finger hastily pointed at Shiro.

"Why did I just say to run away? Are you scared of me? No, no."

The index finger swayed from side to side.

"That's the real victory. You're so angry that you're going crazy and you're sick with anger. Honestly, aren't you frustrated? It's a total liberation."

Pring stretched his arms towards the sky and shouted.

"Strength is true freedom! It's about getting infinite freedom beyond morality, law, and school rules!"

"So... are you infinite now?"

"Huh?"

"The you I see is a hollow that can only suffer endlessly without quenching its thirst."

"Oh, your expression is elegant. For a commoner."

Pring seemed impatient to make Shiro angry in any way.

"No matter what you say, I will keep the line I set."

"Is that so?"

Pring disappeared.

"Then die of overdose."

The moment Pring, who had cast teleportation, tried to jump over the wall, Shiro's flash collided head-on.

"What the!"

When Pring, who had deactivated photonization, retreated without jumping over the wall, Shiro revealed the incarnation of the light angel and charged.

'Is that it? The ability to manipulate time.'

The reason he chose a head-on collision, expecting a fatal wound, was because he could rewind it.

'It's rather good.'

If Pring didn't intend to stick it in anyway, it was up to him to cook it.

Bingbinghwa.

As the ice blade fluttered like petals, Shiro made a big detour and cast a photon cannon.

"Hehehe, are you angry?"

Pring, who sensed the spirit zone, swayed his upper body as if dancing and dodged the flash.

"I'll never get hit. Defensive four-way style...... Huh?"

Pring's eyes narrowed unbelievably.

'Is the spirit zone gone?'

No, it's not that.

'The spirit zone is everywhere. What the hell......?'

Photon cannons sprang up from all sides as the flash popped out next to him.

"Oh my......"

Sabina, who was watching, opened her mouth wide.

The reason why the position of the wizard is important is because it is the focus of the mind.

That's why she couldn't understand the principle of magic being activated when the focus was gone.

"I see now."

Pring, like a combat wizard, only drew conclusions closely related to victory or defeat.

'There is a radius. Only the boundary line is gone. Then......'

Pring's eyes twisted like a seagull and his lips split almost vertically as his wrinkles deepened.

"Run away further."

Sibulsangpokmae!

When Shiro destroyed the shackles of time and the photon cannon rushed over the back of Pring, who had thrown his body,

"What the......!"

When Pring, who had not jumped over the wall and retreated after deactivating the photonization, Shiro revealed the incarnation of the light angel and charged.
