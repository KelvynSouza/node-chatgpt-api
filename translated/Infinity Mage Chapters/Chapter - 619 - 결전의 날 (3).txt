[619] Day of Decision (3)

"Unlucky."

When everyone was fascinated by Arganes, only one woman spat out unpleasant thoughts.

It was Teria, Nade's mother.

"What's so funny about living in luxury because you married well?"

Her ugly husband, Bolum, stopped his wife.

"Stop it. The other nobles will hear."

"Why? You're not embarrassed, are you? Oh, what sin did I commit in my previous life to live like this? That woman lives by plastering money."

Bolum's face turned red.

"Be modest today. It's the day Nade takes the test."

"If the child was good, he wouldn't live like this. How expensive is the school tuition? If he fails today, I'll get him a job at a factory..."

"Stop it!"

When Bolum, who had reached the limit of patience, shouted, the surrounding nobles looked around, but Teria, who had nothing but evil left, did not blink an eye.

"What are you bragging about? Do you think there's a man here who makes less money than you? If you want to brag, make at least a penny and do it!"

Bolum just shut his mouth.

No good words would come out of Teria anyway.

"Oh, it looks like a couple is fighting over there."

Isis, Amy's mother, said, hugging her husband Shakora's arm.

"They might be sensitive. It's the day their child takes the test. Just ignore it."

Isis felt tension in her husband's voice.

"Are you okay? Your face is stiff. Are you worried that Amy might fail?"

"If she fails, she fails. It's just her ability. I'm just worried. The hardest thing now would be Amy."

Carmis's red eyes were a special talent that others envied, but when such a situation came, he didn't feel good because he felt like he was putting unnecessary pressure on his daughter.

"It's been a long time, Mr. Shakora."

Albino, Iruki's father, approached with Arganes.

"Yes. How have you been?"

When Shakora bowed his head politely, Albino looked at Arganes and said.

"Let me introduce you. This is Mr. Shakora of the Carmis family, and his wife, Mrs. Isis."

Arganes bent his knee with a beautiful smile.

"I've heard a lot about you. My name is Arganes."

"Ho ho ho! Of course, I know. You're the most famous actor in the world. Please sign me later!"

Shakora, who was embarrassed, coughed.

"I'm sorry. My wife is very cheerful."

"Oh, no. I'm also a fan of Mrs. Isis. I was so sad that you retired too early."

Albino changed the subject.

"How is Amy? Do you think she's well prepared?"

"From what I saw during the vacation, it seems that she has reached the level she aimed for. But the result is unknown."

"Hehe, you're too modest. After all, it's Carmis."

"How is Iruki? I heard he has a great talent."

"That guy is done. He probably did all the stupid things by himself and fell out on his own. I ran from the capital to tease him when he failed."

Arganes puffed up his cheeks.

"What's wrong with our son? Even if he only looks like me, he should be the best man in the world. Anyway, the Merkodine genes are too strong."

No one would think of Arganes when they saw Iruki.

"But..."

Albino looked around.

"Have Shiro's parents arrived yet?"

"Oh, you know Shiro."

"Of course. The only time Iruki talks to me is when he talks about Shiro. It was an opportunity to rethink my son's sexual preference."

"Oh, that's probably not it. It's a bit awkward to say this, but I think our daughter is looking at Shiro."

"Honey, it's not even certain..."

"Ho, hearing that makes me more curious. The boy who stole the heart of the youngest daughter of the Carmis family."

Shakora turned her gaze to the Ogent family.

"I heard that Shiron is a commoner and is being sponsored. That lady over there is Reyna, the third daughter of the Ogent family."

Four people spotted Reyna, but they couldn't find anyone who looked like Shiron's parents.

"Ah! Why is it so late?"

Reyna, who was checking the time, stomped her feet. At that moment, the Ogent family's carriage arrived from afar.

When the butler, Temuran, opened the door, Vincent and Ollina appeared.

Reyna approached them, their faces pale at the sight of the crowd of nobles.

"Welcome, father. Fortunately, you're not late."

"Thank you for inviting us. But I'm not sure if this is really a place we should be..."

"What are you talking about? Of course, you should be here for Shiron's graduation exam. The participants will be entering soon."

A sleepy voice came from inside the carriage.

"Oh? We've arrived already."

Reyna squinted and shouted.

"Hey! You're just coming now after going to pick up our parents? You almost missed Shiron's entrance!"

"As long as I arrived on time. Anyway, your nagging is..."

Lian, who had a great sword on his back, got off.

His blue hair, sharp eyes like a blade, and perfectly trained physique had an overwhelming aura just by looking at it.

'Shiron....'

Lian looked up at the top of the Colosseum, which would determine Shiron's future.

'You really did it.'

The situation that was unimaginable when he took the knight's oath felt thrilling as it approached reality.

"Oh? That young man with the great sword, isn't he from the Ogent family? It looks like the youngest son, Lian, has come."

"He's called the Sword of Maha. It seems he's quite noticed among the swordsmen."

When the nobles recognized Lian, Reyna secretly bent her finger that was wagging.

"You must have worked hard, there are people who recognize you?"

When he first left for knight practice, it seemed like he was really sending off a younger brother.

"I don't care about reputation. If it wasn't for Shiron's graduation exam, I wouldn't have come home."

"This is really! You're taking your family lightly because I've been pampering you!"

When Reyna kicked Lian's thigh, it felt like hitting a rock.

"Ouch! Are you wearing armor under your pants?"

Lian looked at her pitifully.

"When are you going to grow up, sister? You need to calm down, who would take you with that attitude?"

Reyna, who was rubbing her toes, had a tear in her eye.

'Now he's trying to beat his sister with strength. It's sad, really.'

It seemed like the good old days when she used to boss around her youngest brother were over.

"So, are you leaving again after the graduation exam?"

"I have to leave. My life is just beginning."

"Very busy. Where are you going this time?"

"Of course...."

Lian looked towards the school and smiled.

"Where Shiron is going."

* * *

The noisy bell rang in the dormitory corridor.

"The graduation exam is about to start. Participants, please go to the Colosseum."

"Hoooooo!"

Shiron, who was twisting his waist, opened his eyes wide.

He had stayed up all night, but his mind was the clearest of the year.

Consciously and unconsciously, he had been honing his mental strength in preparation for today, and it had reached its peak.

'It's starting!'

Shiron, who seemed to never return, jumped up and went out into the corridor.

That's how perfect his determination was.

At the same time, students poured out from all sides.

Iruki and Nade walked down the corridor and nodded to Shiron.

They were irreplaceable friends, but for the time being, they had to be without conversation.

"Look, the seniors from the graduation class are coming!"

When they arrived at the Colosseum, the parents who wanted to see the dignity of their proud sons and daughters flocked in.

"Mother, Shiron is coming."

"Euhuhuk!"

When Ollina saw her son and started crying, the one who was rather embarrassed was Reyna.

"Mother, why are you like this? The test hasn't even started yet."

"No... I don't know. Just tears..."

It was a feeling too complex to explain.

"But please bear with it a little. Shirone can't weaken her heart."

Ollina hastily wiped away her tears and firmly closed her lips.

'Mother. Father.'

Shirone looked at her family waiting at the south gate.

'Reina sister. And...'

Lian, who was reliably protecting them, was standing there.

'You're back.'

In a perfect mental state without any distractions, Shirone's mind was only performing factual judgments.

As she turned her cold expression and entered the Colosseum, Lian raised the corner of her mouth.

"You're well prepared."

Reina had the same thought.

Even when she was humiliated in the Kingdom of Kazra, she looked young, but the look in her eyes just now was no different from the official magicians she encounters in society.

"Those who will observe the parents, please enter through the east gate! Advanced students are the west gate!"

At the guide's command, the crowd gathered in front of the Colosseum was sucked into the building in an instant.

The participants who arrived in the waiting room were relaxing their tension with their own know-how, and not a word was spoken.

"Hoo."

Shirone also equipped the two thousand bracelets she received from the staff, took a deep breath, and waited for the time to come.

'It's been a long time since I've been two thousand.'

The large Colosseum, built according to the Red Line standard, was equipped with the latest two thousand devices, and the synchronization rate was also 100 percent.

The power coefficient of magic accurately shocks the spirit, which is no different from actual combat.

Nevertheless, the reason for using the two thousand system is that you can check the status of the participants in numbers, minimize physical loss even while fatal magic is going on, and above all, for the safety of the spectators.

"We will enter the Colosseum in 10 minutes."

At the guide's words, a kind of excitement that she had never experienced before tore her stomach.

The best 10 minutes of her life passed, and the door leading to the Colosseum opened.

'Let's go.'

Shirone, who was number 27, was at the end of the line, but she could tell that it was a different world just by the cheers the leader received.

"Please cheer with applause! They are the proud students of Alpheus Magic School!"

"Waaaaaa!"

It was like a shower of sound was falling.

The sky under the sun was shimmering in gold, and the many people in the audience seats were tangled together and indistinguishable.

"Stand up!"

When the students lined up in a row, Principal Alpheus took the stage.

"I pay tribute to everyone who has reached here."

During the progress of the opening remarks, Shirone looked around the audience seats.

Advanced students and parents, on the other side, teachers were seated, and in the separate VIP seats, scouts from all over the world were sitting.

'This is the graduation test.'

The six items evaluated in the graduation test were PvP, finishing move, high ground occupation, magic operation, tactics and strategy, and extreme survival, with finishing moves and magic operations being non-combat series, and the remaining four items being combat series.

Through the ratio of 4 to 2, it was possible to see that Redline puts a little more weight on combat power when evaluating magicians.

After Olivia's explanation ended, the last event, the oath reading, finally began.

"One! We are children of intellect! One! We never give up in any situation!"

In the climax of the excitement, Shirone couldn't even hear her own voice.

'Finally! Finally!'

The journey from when she jumped over the wall of Alpheus Magic School around the age of twelve to today flashed by like a slide show.

"We will start the graduation test now!"

Thirty students took their places in a circle along the inner wall of the Colosseum, 15 meters apart.

The giant hologram that completely covered the sky had six kinds of events engraved on it as a roulette, and the central compass began to rotate quickly.
