[278] 2. The trap of choosing one (2)

"Shirone, a beautiful butterfly is only a monster when you look at it closely. No one is beautiful in this world except you, and expressing your emotions is not always good. Especially if you want to protect the person you love."

Shirone calmed down her excitement with a deep breath. Now was not the time to get angry, but to come up with a countermeasure.

"What should I do from now on?"

"Show them your power. If they want to have a criterion for judging whose side they should stand on, it might be one way to provide them with an accurate source."

Orkamp finally spat out the words that were inside him.

"Prepare a place for me. Show me your Ataraxia. If you show them your power there, at least Pia will be clearly distinguished. Then they won't touch your family at least."

Shirone's eyes fell down. Her mind calmed down, but a hot energy passed through her esophagus and stuck in her throat.

"That's... the real reason why you called me."

Orkamp sighed softly. As expected, lying didn't work on Shirone.

"Have you heard of Valkyrie? It's an army organized by Teraze to prepare for the final war. The reason why Kazra Kingdom was able to survive economically was thanks to the orders of war weapons there. But the situation is not optimistic. The reason why Teraze planted his children here is to drive me out and swallow Kazra someday. We need to strengthen our influence within Valkyrie. It's possible with your Ataraxia."

Shirone felt the strength drain from her body. She had vaguely guessed, but hearing such words from someone she considered her parents made tears flow out.

In the end, blood ties weren't important. What they wanted was Ataraxia, the ability of an archangel.

"Please do it. Show me your demonstration. Just showing it in front of the nobles will have a huge impact. It's an opportunity to pull the neutralists to our side."

Shirone swallowed her tears hard. Orkamp wasn't crying, so she shouldn't cry either.

"Do you think I'll just follow along if you say that?"

"Rather the opposite. That's why I'm going to make a suggestion. You said before that you wanted to go home. Is that still valid?"

"No, it's not valid anymore. Because I want to go home more than before."

Orkamp didn't get annoyed by Shirone's sarcastic words.

"If you show me your demonstration, I'll send you home as soon as your paternity test is over. You can go to magic school or do whatever you want. If you don't want to come to the palace, you don't have to. How about that?"

Shirone couldn't just pass this offer by.

Having experienced the palace, going home was not as easy as she thought at first. In that situation, Orkamp's offer was definitely tempting.

"But then you won't be able to use Ataraxia. You'll need me eventually, how are you going to convince your substitutes?"

Orkamp felt anxious as if he had revealed his true feelings. The reason why he suggested the demonstration was for a much bigger purpose than attracting neutralists.

Arius said that if he saw Ataraxia himself, he would find a way to replicate it.

Once replication succeeds, Shirone is not needed. No, rather it would be better for her to leave the palace. For Shirone's life...

"That's why a secret deal is needed. I'll announce to the substitutes that you're coming back after graduating from magic school. Was it a year? During that time, I'll wipe out Teraze's faction. After that, we can each go our own way."

In the end, it meant that if he failed to wipe out Teraze's faction, the deal would be invalidated.

But Shirone also nodded her head as if she thought that kind of risk was natural. As long as he guaranteed one year, she didn't care if he kept his promise or not.

She was going to move anyway after graduating from magic school. She just thought that the moving distance was a little farther.

At least until I have enough power to not be shaken by the royal authority, wouldn't it be fine to live like that?

"Who will be attending the demonstration?"

"I already arranged it by rank. All the high nobles will gather. They are expecting a splendid show."

Syrone looked at Orkampf with sad eyes.

"You knew from the beginning that I couldn't refuse, didn't you?"

"Syrone, it was your own proposal three days ago. I just gave you a reason to accept it."

Orkampf was cold until the end.

But thanks to him, Syrone regained his composure. It wasn't for Kazra. It was for his family.

"I understand. Please call me when the preparations are done. I have to go see my 'parents' now."

He wanted to just leave. He also knew that Orkampf wouldn't scold him even if he did.

But Syrone left the room with courtesy.

Orkampf was the king of a neighboring country.

When Syrone arrived at his lodging, he checked on his parents first.

They looked like they hadn't slept all night, with dark circles under their eyes. They tried to smile for fear of worrying their son, but Olina's face was pale as paper.

He had learned magic himself, and his heart was pounding. It must have been too much for her, who had lived her whole life without harming anyone.

"I'm sorry, mother."

Amy greeted Syrone with a forced smile, neither pretending to be cheerful nor showing any tension. She just raised her hand and smiled bitterly.

Syrone felt a strong bond with her.

Reyna, who was having a meeting with the servants in the next room, greeted him with a bright expression.

"You're here, Syrone. I've been waiting for you."

Everyone was tense, but Reyna was full of energy. She definitely had the spirit of a court musician, enjoying the lively atmosphere.

It was refreshing to see her new side, but he wasn't in a good mood at this moment.

He didn't hate her. But no one would know how he felt when he had entrusted his family's lives to someone else and became a fool for a day.

"I met Orkampf."

Reyna's expression hardened.

It wasn't just Syrone's cold voice, but also the fact that he called the king by his name that made her guess how angry he was about this matter.

"I'm sorry I didn't tell you in advance. But I thought you would worry..."

"I know why you did it. But we were all in danger."

Reyna swallowed hard. She had seen it once in her hometown, the expression that Syrone only showed when he was really angry.

She felt her heart freeze when she was on the receiving end. Did her father feel the same way back then?

"It's okay now. I strengthened the security measures. I asked the guards to increase security..."

"You should have told me."

Reyna's mouth closed like a clam. Then Amy sighed as if she had seen hell.

'That's what I told you.'

She had overlooked how much Syrone loved his family, and that's why this happened.

But honestly, Amy had nothing to say either. She knew Syrone's reaction very well, but she followed Reyna's judgment because she was right.

Even now, he was angry, but if he had known then, things could have gotten out of control. Syrone knew that too. That's why it was Reyna's victory in the end.

Vincent looked embarrassed and defended Syrone.

"Syrone, Reyna was in a position where she had no choice. Besides, she asked for our understanding before making the decision. You should be angry at me instead."

Syrone lowered his head. He knew that from the start.

He was just angry.

He felt so sad that he shivered when he thought that his family was threatened by assassination, his biological parents were obsessed with Ataraxia, and now even Reyna seemed to push him away.

"I'm sorry. I know Reyna saved us all. It's just... I felt so frustrated that I didn't know what I was doing."

Reina sensed a faint sob in Shirone's voice. What did she hear from Orcamp that made the normally strong girl return so broken? 

"No, I'm sorry. It was enough to hurt you. It was also one of my duties to tell you. From now on, I'll report everything to you."

Shirone tried to smile and Reina felt relieved.

She was most beautiful when she smiled. That's why she didn't want to see her sad face.

She had to be cold to get out of the palace safely. Even if the same situation came, Reina was determined to make the same decision.

As their emotions converged, Amy asked.

"So what did you talk about in the real room?"

"Oh, that..."

Shirone told her what Orcamp had suggested. Amy pondered carefully and nodded.

"Hmm, that's a good suggestion. Of course, if he keeps his promise."

"I don't care. Anyway, I have to move when I graduate. I think I can deal with the next problem then. So I accepted the offer for now."

"Yeah, me too."

The reason why nobles had the concept of hometown was because they moved their residence depending on their job.

Amy's brother Dian was also an archer captain in the palace, and especially her second brother Ares, who was an explorer, was wandering around the wilderness and it was unclear which country he was in.

The employment rate of magicians worldwide was about 80 percent and the employment rate was close to 99 percent. The reason why the employment rate was lower than the employment rate was because there were quite a lot of magicians who refused to work.

But competition was fierce, so most students went up to the capital Bashuka to find a job or prepare for the public exam after graduation. If neither was easy, it was common to go abroad for study.

There were magic institutions in Creas as well, but Shirone didn't want to end her magic life in a local city either.

She thought she might be able to become a deputy director of the Magic Association Creas branch if she reached level 5 in the future, but she had a lot of things she wanted to do right now.

Alpheus Magic School was a national designated institution and graduated with a non-public level 10 magician certificate. Once you get a certificate, you can get a job from the guild, so you can also live as a mercenary. Then there is no need to buy a house, so it will be easy to move around.

She thought she could settle somewhere if she met a good fate while living like that.

Amy clapped her hands and cheered as if she supported Shirone's intention.

"Good! Let's do it right if we're going to do it!"

@

The Colosseum was built on a branch land 2 kilometers north of Kazra Palace. It used to be a huge gambling board where gladiators fought with beasts and nobles bet money, but it is currently closed indefinitely for financial reasons of the palace.

Bloodstains remained on the uncleaned ash floor. No matter how much the workers swept with brooms, the red bloodstains did not disappear.

The nobles entered with escorts and Amy and Reina also took their seats on the third floor auditorium.

Orcamp allowed Shirone's parents to attend out of consideration for her feelings, but Ollina's mental and physical condition had weakened, so Vincent decided to stay at the inn with her.

Shirone waited for time in the waiting room under the Colosseum.

There were exercise equipment and sandbags used by champions around him, and various weapons were displayed on shelves.

The iron door of the waiting room opened and Zion and Uorin entered. Uorin looked around as if it was his first time in the underground waiting room.

Shirone didn't welcome anyone anymore. Everyone looked like an enemy after knowing what happened last night.

Zion approached with his arms crossed and said.

"It's quite a bleak place. What did the warriors who waited here think? Please don't get eaten by lions? Or maybe they were trying to break that door and run away."

"No, they must have vowed to kill their enemies. That's the only way left for warriors."

Zion smiled with a twisted grin. As expected, he was no match for the magician with words.
