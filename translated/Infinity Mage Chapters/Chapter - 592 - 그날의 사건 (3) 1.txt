[592] The Incident of That Day (3)

"Do you know me?"

Shirone asked.

"What are you talking about? How would I know you?"

Sure enough, the maze that he first discovered when he entered Istas was undoubtedly where he met Shirone.

"I don't know how to explain it......"

It was true.

"I know you, Maze. I fought with you and learned a lot from you."

Maze's face, which had been blinking for a moment, soon became serious.

"You succeeded."

He was talking about Geppin's command.

"Then how long after time closed did you come?"

"19 years."

It was an encounter with a boy from the future, 19 years later.

What happens to his fate, is he living happily, how did the final war go, Shirone prepared answers in advance, imagining the hypothetical questions Maze would ask.

But all he heard was a cold voice.

"Why are you here?"

"Huh?"

"If the mission was successful, you should have buried the incident by destroying Istas. Why did you come back?"

"Well, that's......"

Maze, who was frustrated, cut off his words.

"Did you really come in without knowing where this is? The infinite loop structure of time. The event could have been twisted by you coming in! How are you going to take responsibility?"

As Shirone lost his words and stood blankly, Maze, who had been thinking, threw another question.

"You, by any chance, Fermini?"

He didn't want such a misunderstanding.

"No. I'm Shirone."

Shirone?

Maze frowned.

"Hmm. Shirone."

No matter how much he racked his brain, it was a name he had never heard before.

"Anyway, don't do anything from now on. Stay out of the event as much as possible."

"I can't do that. The reason I came in here is......"

"We don't need reasons like that. Just prepare for the end of your life. After all, when 'Hexa' dies, this world will end."

"What is Hexa?"

Maze pointed to the child in his arms.

"This child. Geppin plans to deviate Hexa from cosmic initialization. You understand? If Hexa disappears, it will destroy the human race called Anke."

Deviating from cosmic initialization.

"Does that mean it won't disappear even if it's reset?"

As soon as he dug into the core, Maze was momentarily puzzled, but soon agreed.

'Well, there's no such thing as coincidence.'

There was almost zero chance that someone without that much information would infiltrate the upper echelons 19 years later.

"That's right. Only Hexa can withstand the reset of Ra. So sacrifice yourself. Let me complete my mission."

Shirone swallowed his saliva.

"Maybe, that child might be me."

"What?"

Maze, who was looking at him absurdly, stared at Hexa's face.

"Now that I think about it, it does look similar."

The feeling of the original does not easily disappear even if the appearance changes as it grows.

"But I don't know. If you're Hexa, why are you here?"

Shirone was frustrated by the situation of continuing to make assumptions.

"I might be Geppin's son."

"What?"

Maze's eyes popped open.

"So tell me. What on earth is happening here?"

"Ha ha......"

The laughter gradually grew louder and reached its peak.

"Ha ha ha ha!"

It was not just a pleasant feeling, so Shirone was confused and angry.

"Why are you laughing?"

"You're Geppin's son? No, there's no way."

"How do you know that, Maze? Did you ask Geppin directly?"

"No, that's......"

Maze laughed again as if it was absurd, and then cut off his words.

"There's no need to ask. There's no way you could be Geppin's son."

"So how can you be sure of that?"

Shirone's voice rose, but Maze looked absurd.

"Don't you really know? Geppin is the most famous wizard in this world. There's no one who doesn't know that."

"How does that make sense?"

Finally, as Shiro raised his voice, Miro also shouted as if frustrated.

"Fool! Geopin doesn't look like us!"

Silence flowed.

"......Yes?"

Shiro's face was dumbfounded.

"Not like us......?"

Miro finally realized.

"Oh, did you mean he was erased?"

In Shiro's time, no one could accurately recall Geopin's appearance.

"I'm sorry. I didn't think about that. I've never experienced erasure either. Anyway, you're not Geopin's child. You look completely different."

"Are you saying I'm not human?"

Miro seriously considered.

When an intellectual species that he had never seen before appeared, which species to classify it into was a problem that was resolved by compromise between the party and the members of society.

"Human......yes. You have all the characteristics of a human, and Geopin also claimed to be human."

That's why Geopin is protecting humanity against heaven.

"But he is a species called the ancient Gaia. It's a bit......"

Shiro knew the fact, but he had never heard about the appearance of Gaia.

"So what does Geopin look like?"

Miro stroked his chin.

"Hmm, it's a bit surprising at first, but it's strange? So the face is......"

Miro's eyes, which were recalling Geopin's appearance, shook with shock.

"I can't remember."

"What?"

Instead of answering, Miro looked at Hexa.

He was still asleep in his arms, but his physicality was gradually disappearing.

"It's a big deal! The case has been twisted! Hexa is said to have died in the future!"

Because the beginning and the end are connected, Hexa's death can affect the current Hexa.

"Huh? Uh?"

Shiro raised both hands with a bewildered expression.

As Hexa's presence faded, Shiro's body was also gradually blurring.

"Why is this happening?"

This proved it.

"Hexa. Are you really Hexa?"

If Hexa dies, Shiro cannot exist.

Furthermore, the fact that Geopin's memory is disappearing means that the time curvature has opened.

In other words, she was about to meet Geopin's erasure without fulfilling Geopin's command.

"No!"

Miro jumped up and pulled Shiro's collar.

"Get out of this coordinate now!"

He didn't know what future would unfold, but creating variables was the only way to survive.

"But...... where should I go?"

"Geopin's door! Come there! I'll fix Hexa there! You must protect that incident at all costs!"

Shiro nodded reluctantly.

"Hurry! There's no time!"

When Miro left the room, Shiro also cast a time-space explosion.

"Kuuk!"

Again, it felt like his head was going to break, and huge events were recognized all at once.

"Huck! Huck!"

The space was the same, but in a completely different time, Shiro fell forward and gasped for breath.

He survived.

The sense of physical existence was reviving again.

'Why did Miro's mission fail?'

It was the first thought that came to mind.

'I just met Miro.'

He didn't harm Miro, nor did he intend to.

The only part he could guess was......

'Because I asked about Geopin.'

Curiosity about Geopin messed up the job.

'So, does that mean that my future self failed Miro's mission because of my obsession with Geopin?'

Mission failure meant nothing but Hexa's death.

'I have to go to the Supernatural Spirit Science Research Society!'

It was the place where Geopin's door, which Miro mentioned, was.

'Please don't be late.'

Checking the mark of the warehouse, Shiro ran in the opposite direction of where Miro had gone.

Time: 0:53.

Space: Eastas Warehouse No. 65.

"Kuk."

Only corpses were left in the place where the labyrinth swept through.

"Damn woman."

The only survivor was Lucang, the assassin of Mars 1st team.

Despite his young age of twenty-two, he was a talent who entered Mars, a secret unit of the Thorumia Kingdom, recognized for his swordsmanship and excellent judgment.

"I thought life was easy."

It was a dangerous job, but he was confident and the future was bright.

'This is just saying to go and die.'

All 42 members of Mars wrote their wills before coming here.

It was a kind of death certificate written knowing that they could never return, not because they could die.

'What is patriotism.'

Honestly, he didn't want to do it.

He wanted to shout that he would quit and go back to his hometown right away.

'What's the use of honor when you die?'

But no one did, and everyone is dying.

Even if he had refused the mission, he would have died, but if he was going to die like this, he should have struggled with his face and everything.

"Hehehe! Damn world."

When Lucang stepped back with both hands on the ground, only the lower body that had collapsed from the pelvis remained eerily in place.

'How to beat a monster?'

If the labyrinth hadn't paid attention to the child, his body would have already become a rat like his colleagues.

'The limit is to hold on with the schema.'

As the power drained, blood flowed down under the internal organs.

"Is it over......"

When the focus was off his eyes, the door opened and a group of people came in.

&lt;Event Coordinates&gt;

Time: 1:01.

Space: Istas Warehouse No. 65.

"Huh? Survivor......"

Behind the petite woman were two men and a slender woman who looked powerful just by looking at them.

"Yolga."

Lucang raised his head with difficulty and took her in his eyes.

Her dark brown hair covered her forehead with a gentle curve, and her face was clear and transparent.

She was small in stature but an outstanding beauty.

"Damn!"

Lucang distorted his face like a demon.

The only ones who can hold out against the inhuman monster Miro are Yolga and her colleagues.

When Mars was dying, there was no sign of it, but what does it mean to appear now?

"Are you okay? You're seriously injured."

Yolga approached as she pulled her hood.

"Seriously injured? Does this look injured? It's all because of you. Disgusting thing."

"Calm down. It's dangerous."

"I'm going to die anyway. Everyone dies because of you."

Yolga closed her mouth.

"I know. If you hadn't twisted the king, Mars wouldn't have had to go out."

"I'm sorry. But we still need Gopin. It's still impossible to withstand the army of heaven."

"Shut up! What does the army of heaven have to do with it! I'm going to die, what's all that!"

"I'm sorry."

Yolga bowed her head, and Lucang, who had been glaring at her, gathered a lot of blood in his mouth.

"Spit!"

And he spat on her face.

"You bastard!"

Edgar, a two-meter giant standing behind Yolga, approached with his mechanical arm swinging.

"Don't you have any faith? Are you so afraid of dying?"

"It's just a pity to die. From the beginning, we were not opponents of the labyrinth. I guess we needed a meat shield."

"I'll cut off your life that's not much left."

As Edgar approached with his steel fist, Yolga raised her hand to stop him.

"If you have a will, please do. I will deliver it."

"Heh, you can't go back anyway. It's over."

Lucang, who had been dying, thought for a moment and laughed.

"If you want to repent so much, how about a kiss? I've been killing you since I first saw you."

"......"

"Oh, were you a married woman? What does it matter, if you're going to die anyway? Oh, I don't have a lower body?"

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
