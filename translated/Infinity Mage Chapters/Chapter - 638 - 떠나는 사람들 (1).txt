[638] Departing People (1)

The administrator made a business trip broadcast, but many people who still had the aftereffects of the graduation exam could not leave their seats.

Baikal was also collecting the voices of foreign scouts while keeping his seat.

As expected, the name that came out the most from their mouths was Shirone, and Elizabeth was proud of that point.

"It's worth coming to Alpheus Magic School. I don't know how the exams in other regions were, but they won't get as much attention as here."

Now, what the scouts have to do is to write a report.

Detailed evaluations of all 30 people will be recorded, and after classifying them according to their grades and submitting them to the association, they will determine the contract conditions from the royal magic department and enter into formal negotiations.

"We must catch Shirone. Scouts from other countries have already started moving. They will be preparing a huge signing bonus and options."

"We still have a chance. According to the Red Line Agreement, the magic department within the country has the right to negotiate first for students produced from schools in their own country."

Even if it was a foreign student from another country, it was the same.

"It won't be easy to persuade Shirone. He has definitely established his skills. If he invokes the right to refuse negotiations and is disclosed on the Red Line, countries around the world will competitively raise contract conditions. There is no reason for him to accept."

"......You calculated this from the beginning and took the graduation exam. Now the position has been reversed."

Lara said.

"We have to raise it drastically, not just renewing the highest contract conditions. If you think that proposals will come from the empire, it is definitely not a loss."

Elizabeth agreed.

"If it's a reasonable level, Shirone wouldn't want to leave Thormia. After all, it's where he's lived his whole life."

It's not easy to leave a place where the history of life is contained.

"The problem is that reasonable level. The breakthrough is also based on experience. The current highest salary in the kingdom is 24 million gold, which was signed 10 years ago. Even excluding additional benefits and options, there were many talks among the nobles. After all, it was just a graduate without a public certificate."

If it's 24 million gold, it's an amount that an average economic activity in the mercenary guild of Thormia, a non-public magician, can't earn even if he works for 10,000 years.

Considering the enormous value created by magic, it was an income gap that could not be accepted.

It was the peculiarity of the magic field created by the monopoly of manpower-based industries that cannot exist in general, the problem directly linked to national defense, and the competitive psychology of countries around the world integrated through the Red Line network.

In fact, it was a common sentiment in each country that they wanted to keep a magician known in the world by pouring out billions of gold a year.

"But the party to that contract easily passed the public and is now the commander of the Royal Guard Magic Corps. If it's worth renewing the highest contract, the public is not a problem."

"Then how much do you suggest? 100 million? 1 billion? The empire can pay. It's not because Shirone's magic is 100 times, 1,000 times stronger. It's because it's magic that only Shirone can do. If you hit it with money, the kingdom can't compete."

If it's a veteran Baikal's prediction, it's probably accurate.

"First of all, we have to suggest something more than money in the negotiations. Giving a noble title is one way, since he said he was a commoner. But I'm skeptical about whether the magic department will do that."

"Why? Shouldn't we catch Shirone?"

"That's because we think so because we are magicians and scouts. There are many things to consider, such as the backlash of the nobles, the fall of the royal pony. From now on, it's politics."

Baikal's wrinkles deepened.

"And politics always betray personal common sense."

The participants who took a break in the waiting room left the Colosseum only after all the spectators had left their seats.

The spectators who had not yet left the school clapped from afar, and many parents were looking for their children.

"Mom!"

Shirone, who found Ollina and Vincent standing with the people of the Ogent family, ran to them.

"Shirone!"

The first person to hug was naturally Ollina, and she buried her face in the chest of her son who had now grown up and shed tears.

"Was it hard? Are there any injuries?"

Despite overcoming the huge mountain of passing the graduation exam, Shirone's eyes also turned red at the simple character of taking care of her child's health first.

"I'm okay, Mom. I'm sorry."

He didn't want to show a fiercely fighting figure.

"You've worked hard. You really worked hard, Shirone."

Lian and Reina were watching the scene where Vincent hugged his son and wife at the same time with a pleased expression.

Other participants were also reunited with their parents, and Amy's mother, Isis, pointed to the Colosseum.

"Amy is coming there."

It seemed like she was lost in thought, and her face, which also looked blank, could not read emotions.

"Amy, here."

Amy, who heard Isis's voice, suddenly came to her senses and approached with her head bowed.

Final graduation ranking 4th.

Although she was in the upper ranks, it was uncertain whether her pride, who had never missed the first place since she was young, would accept it.

"I'm worried. She must have been greedy because she even repeated the year."

Amy's father, Shakora, said sternly.

"Don't show it. Pretending not to know helps."

Amy, who stopped in front of the two, bowed her head and shivered her shoulders.

"Mom. Dad."

At a time when she didn't know what to say, she made a V with her hand while shedding tears.

"I... I did it. I passed."

Shakora, who was choked up, couldn't control his emotions and hugged his daughter.

"That's right! Great, our daughter! You're the best!"

It's 4th place now, but it doesn't mean it's forever 4th place.

How burdensome it would have been to carry the honor of the Carmis family on her back and take the second test.

'From now on, it's the beginning, Amy! Be proud of what you've done!'

If she did her best and was satisfied, the child's ranking was not important to the parents.

"Our daughter passed!"

When Shakora forgot his face and shouted, Isis's face turned red.

"Honey, don't do it. Like a fire..."

"Ahaha!"

Amy, who wiped her tears while sniffling, smiled brightly.

Unlike the Carmis family, where family love overflowed, the members of the Merkodain family were calm.

"I didn't even expect you to graduate from school. It seems my head is rusty now."

Albino's first words made Arganes poke his side.

"Is that what you say to your son? Congratulations, Iruki."

Arganes honored his son, and Iruki just nodded his head.

She was definitely a biological mother who had been breastfed, but the Merkodain lineage separated emotions and reason, and therefore, it was difficult for Arganes to deal with her son as he grew up.

"It's definitely rusty. Should I open it and wipe it for you?"

"Kukkukkukkuk!"

Albino, who shrugged his shoulders at the inhuman joke unique to Merkodain, touched his nose and asked.

"So, what are you going to do now? If you're sure you're going to wipe my head, I won't refuse."

Iruki looked around the Colosseum.

"I'm satisfied. I'll go to Yongno."

The corner of Albino's mouth rose ominously.

Machines use and throw away, but humans duplicate.

If it was Iruki, it wouldn't have been enough for his successor.

"Are you okay? This field is not easy either. I think it's a good life to become a wizard."

"I said I was satisfied."

It was enough to ask twice to confirm the resolution.

"Come to the capital after graduation. Prepare."

Each family has different tendencies, but in the end, they are family.

And in some part, a family that was less than others was having an awkward reunion.

"Congratulations."

Borum offered a handshake, but Nade turned his head as if he didn't want to say anything.
[Translated block]


The embarrassed ballroom gathered his hands and pushed his wife's back, saying.

"You say something too."

Teria glared fiercely, but Nade was not as scary as before.

Because he had gained the freedom to do anything.

"Are you going to be a wizard?"

Teria, who didn't care about her son, knew exactly which wizard was making a fortune.

Of course, she knew that if she was second in the graduation exam, she could hit the jackpot with a contract fee.

"No. I'm not going to be a wizard. There's no association to take me."

Teria's face was crumpled.

"What the hell are you, why we sent you to magic school...!"

"I know. If you don't want to, don't."

At Bolrum's words, Teria opened her eyes wide.

"Honey! What are you talking about!"

"You stop it too. We didn't do well either. So, Nade, what are you going to do if you're not a wizard?"

They were people who didn't want to mix a word, but they were family who opened their mouths.

"I'm not going to quit right away, but I'm going to work a little because I'm qualified even if I'm not official. Then I want to open an alchemy business with the money I've saved. Not West, but my name."

It was a word full of denial and distrust of the family, but Bolrum nodded and took out a document from his pocket.

"Take it. It's land that I saved to give you someday. Sell it and use it to open a store."

Nade looked up with a strange expression, but the more surprised one was Teria.

"Honey! How can you do this without consulting me...! No, before that, where did this money come from?"

"It's not your money. It's not my money either. Grandfather left it for you. So don't worry and take it."

"You're telling me now! How are we living now!"

Bolrum pulled Nade's hand and handed him the document.

"There is something called an opportunity for people. Maybe this is the last chance to be a parent."

Looking at the envelope with his grandfather's signature, Nade handed it to Teria without emotion.

"Take it. I don't need it."

At the unexpected words, the blood drained from Teria's face.

"I want to try it alone from now on. So you use it. I'll pay back the money that went into me someday."

Teria, who had to put out a fire, had no choice but to accept it, but her pride was shattered.

"Are you going to cut off the relationship? You're not going to see it again?"

"That's not it. I'll visit you when I'm stable. Take care."

The moment Nade turned around, Teria said quietly.

"...I was going to go."

Nade's steps stopped.

"I was going to go back, too."

"I know."

For the first time since he was born, Nade was able to smile in front of his mother.

"Don't worry. I'm not scared anymore."

He will not resent anyone or hate the world.

When he desperately swims and arrives on land, maybe then will be the day when he can truly laugh?

While Nade was sending off his parents, Shirone was having a long-awaited reunion with Lian.

"Thank you, Lian. I heard the story."

If it weren't for Lian's dance, he would still be wandering in the hell of the apocalypse.

"Hahaha! It's a matter of course! You'll be surprised to know how strong I am!"

He could feel that Lian was not the Lian he used to know just by the energy he exuded.

"In that sense......"

Lian's eyes sparkled.

"Let's have a match with a sword. Revenge for the defeat of the past... Ouch!"

Reina couldn't stand it and hit the back of her head.

"Why is everything you think about childish? What's important now?"

"It's an important issue for me! I have to win Shirone!"

'He's still the same.'

Although his body grew, Lian was Lian.

"Lian, I can't beat you with a sword now."

Lian, who was embarrassed, coughed.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
