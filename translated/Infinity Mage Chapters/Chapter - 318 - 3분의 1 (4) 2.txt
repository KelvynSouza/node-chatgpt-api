"Hey, what are you doing? Get out of the way!" Fermi shouted at Syrone.

Syrone ignored him and glared at him with a cold expression. He knew that Fermi and his gang were troublemakers who liked to hang out with the failed students and drag them into their bad habits.

"Aww, come on. Don't be so rude. We're all friends here, right?" Fermi said with a fake smile. "We just want to invite Amy to our party. It's going to be fun, trust me. There will be drinks, music, games, and maybe even some magic tricks. You know, the kind that make you forget about your worries for a while."

Amy clenched her fists and bit her lip. She felt a surge of anger and frustration at Fermi's words. She didn't need his pity or his fake sympathy. She had worked hard for the graduation exam, but she had failed again. She felt like she had let down her parents, her friends, and herself.

She wanted to scream at Fermi and tell him to leave her alone. She wanted to cry and vent out her emotions. She wanted to run away and hide from everyone.

But she didn't do any of that. She knew that it would only make things worse. She knew that Fermi was trying to provoke her and make her lose control. She knew that Syrone was protecting her and trying to keep her calm.

She took a deep breath and looked at Syrone with gratitude. He was always there for her, no matter what. He was her best friend, her confidant, her guardian angel.

She smiled weakly and shook her head.

"Thanks, but no thanks. I'm not interested in your party." She said firmly.

Fermi frowned and narrowed his eyes.

"Oh, really? You think you're too good for us? You think you're better than us?" He sneered.

He took a step closer to Amy and reached out his hand to grab her arm.

"Come on, don't be a spoilsport. Let's go have some fun." He said in a low voice.

Syrone reacted quickly and pushed Fermi's hand away.

"Don't touch her!" He shouted.

Fermi stumbled back and glared at Syrone.

"What's your problem, man? Why are you always sticking your nose in other people's business? You think you're some kind of hero?" He spat.

He clenched his fists and prepared to throw a punch at Syrone.

Syrone stood his ground and faced Fermi with a defiant look.

"I'm not a hero. I'm just a friend." He said calmly.

He put his arm around Amy's shoulder and pulled her closer to him.

"And she's my friend too. So back off." He added.

Fermi snorted and shook his head.

"Fine, fine. Have it your way." He said sarcastically.

He turned around and walked away with his gang.

"But don't come crying to me when you regret it later." He said over his shoulder.

He laughed mockingly and disappeared into the crowd.

Amy sighed and leaned against Syrone's chest.

"Thank you, Syrone. You're amazing." She said softly.

Syrone hugged her gently and stroked her hair.

"Don't mention it, Amy. You're amazing too." He said warmly.

He looked into her eyes and smiled.

"Come on, let's go home." He said kindly.

He took her hand and led her away from the colosseum.

They walked together in silence, feeling each other's presence and comfort.

They didn't need words to express their feelings.

They knew they had each other, and that was enough.

"That's a face I want to hit. But give me a break today. I'm dying of pain because of that little girl. It always happens when the top ranks clash early. My life is messed up too."

Fermi had put up a shield in advance and watched Siro's reaction. But no words came out of Siro's mouth.

Then Fermi turned his attention back to Amy.

"Haha! Anyway, Amy, what are you going to do...."

Siro blocked Fermi again.

This time, Fermi didn't stay still either. His eyes turned cold for a moment and he looked down at Siro with pressure.

Siro calmly let go of that gaze. Any words would only hurt Amy. He wished he wouldn't approach Amy.

"Lovers are a good thing. Yeah, well... have a good time together."

Fermi turned away without hesitation and walked away. He joined his group and shouted as if the world was leaving.

"Let's go! Let's drink, you miserable lives!"

"Hahaha! Yeah! Let's drink to death today!"

Siro looked back at Amy. She didn't seem to care from the start, she turned her body and looked far away.

"Let's go, Amy. I'll take you home."

"......Yeah."

A heavy silence flowed between the two on their way to the dormitory for the graduating class.

Amy, who had been looking at the ground and walking, frowned and looked at Siro.

"Phew, really can't stand it. Hey!"

"Huh?"

"Why are you so down since earlier? That makes me weird too. If you have something to say, say it, what are you so unhappy about?"

"But there's nothing to say."

"That's exactly it. I just failed the graduation exam. I'm not the only one who failed in the world, and even if I'm the only one who failed, it's not the end of my life. But why are you making such a mood?"

Amy said that and Siro got some courage.

"Haha! That's true. Anyway, did I get another chance?"

"Hmph, you should be grateful. I'll never make such a mistake again."

"A mistake once is a fertilizer for development, a mistake twice is a disgrace to the family?"

"Of course. And tell your stupid friends too. Next year's graduation class will be very fierce. I have to kill them from the beginning."

Siro heard Amy's words like this. Tell them I'm sorry for disappointing them.

But she didn't have to worry. Nade and Iluki were confident that Amy would recover.

The two returned to their usual selves and chatted about this and that as they arrived at the dormitory. Although they failed the exam, they felt relieved that the tension that had built up for a year was gone.

"Haah, I'm tired. I need to go in and wash and sleep."

"Yeah, don't think about anything today and rest."

"Yeah. See you tomorrow. Thanks for taking me home."

Amy, who had a tired face, said goodbye to Siro and entered the dormitory. The air in the hallway was different from the morning. Somewhere, even coldness was felt.

Amy entered her room and sighed as soon as she closed the door. No matter how tired she was, she had to wash because she had sweated a lot.

But her footsteps stopped on her way to the shower room. Transparent tears flowed from her eyes.

"Sob! Sniff......!"

She was angry.

She was so angry that she could die.

Why me? One third of them passed, but 10 people who studied with me are now magicians, why can't I do it?

My condition was great too, why am I still here at school? Why do I have to go through this hellish year again?

Amy collapsed on the bed and clenched her blanket. She couldn't stop her face from turning into a crying face.

"Uaaaaa...... Uaaaaaang!"

Siro took his hand off the doorknob and leaned his back against the wall. He didn't seem to be able to see her anymore today.

"Uaaaaa...... Uaaaaaang......"

I feel sorry for Amy and Siro. They seem to have a hard time because of their exam results and their feelings for each other. Do you want me to write more about what happens next? Or do you want me to do something else?

Amy's cry was so harsh that it seemed like she was out of breath.

"......"

But Shirone just looked up at the ceiling with deep eyes, and just kept his place for a long time.

Even after the lights-out time, the light was on in Alpheus's annex. Olivia's angry voice leaked out of the window.

"Does this make sense? How did you manage the students?"

Olivia, who supervised the graduation exam of Alpheus Magic School for the first time, was shocked. And as soon as the test was over, she searched the students' profiles thoroughly in the library.

"These kids here!"

Olivia shook the profile and threw it on the table where Alpheus was.

The paper stuck together and spread to the left and right, revealing some students' names.

It was Fermi Paggery.

Alpheus glanced at the profile for a moment and opened his mouth as if he was not interested.

"Calm down. The test is over. It's irreversible, and there's no reason to reverse it."

"Why is there no reason? The participants colluded, didn't they?"

"Collusion is also part of the strategy. Situation judgment is also an important factor in battle."

"Who doesn't know that? The problem is collusion that is separate from the tactical flow. They came in with their sides already divided before they even took the test. Why? What do you get by doing that?"

Alpheus couldn't answer that either. It had been happening every year since Fermi entered the graduating class.

It's not really a benefit to drop a specific target in a battle royale style. More than anything, what's strange is that they end up being eliminated in the end.

"The graduation exam is not just a school problem. It's a national qualification exam. The same goes for tactical flow. You can't change the criteria for passing by just one teacher's personal judgment."

Olivia snorted.

"Do you think my eyes are rotten cod eyes? Fermi didn't show half of his skills in this test. He's a kid who can become a pro and still have room to spare. Does it make sense that he hasn't passed for six years when he can graduate right away if he goes to the Royal Magic School?"

"Then what do you want to do? Just let Fermi graduate? Then why do you need a graduation exam? That way, it will only cause backlash from the students who participate in the test."

Olivia walked around the room with frustration and flopped down on the sofa.

"I don't understand. Why don't you graduate? What's good about staying at school?"

"I asked him before. He said something like this place makes money."

Olivia's upper body bounced up.

"That's a graduation broker, isn't it? If you take money and pass graduation, it's not something that ends with school-level discipline. It's committing a crime against the state."

"I checked behind him, but there was nothing. He said he didn't get a penny."

Olivia rested her chin and fell into thought.

If there is no record of receiving money, it would be innocent, but if you think based on suspicion, it means there is something else.

"Fermi is... an irregular eater?"

Alpheus nodded his head.

"Maybe. I don't know how it makes money, but if it's an irregular eater, I can't dig into it. Unless Fermi casts it. But I've never seen him do it in seven graduation exams."

"Then shouldn't we start from there? Whether you take money or use magic to get paid, it's the same. There's no one here, so I'm saying this, but honestly Samuel's movement wasn't good today. But he passed. Amy should have been in that spot."

"I had a similar thought too. But that's only something you can say because there's no one here. It's impossible without solid evidence. What if we start an investigation and it turns out not to be? Do you think there will be any nobles who will sit still when their children are branded as criminals?"

Olivia leaned back on the sofa and cooled her hot head with her palms.

"So what are you going to do? Do you have any ideas?"

"No. I took the graduation exam as usual every year, and the passers became wizards. Whether Robbie is there or not, that fact does not change."

"But you can't say you measured your skills exactly."

"Really?"

Olivia raised one eyebrow.

"What do you mean?"
