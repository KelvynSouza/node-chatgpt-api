"That's really amazing."

Shirone categorized the unconsciousness perfectly. To be honest, it didn't seem like a human thing beyond the word amazing.

Armin's party turned their bodies to the sound of footsteps coming from the entrance. Shirone, who had a darker complexion than before, walked in with a breathless breath.

"I'm feeling a little better. Let's go down quickly."

Amy wiped her tears and approached Shirone.

"Are you okay? I'll support you."

"Get away. I don't want your help."

"But we have to go anyway. Come here."

Amy didn't care about the strong backlash and supported Shirone.

Shirone had no choice but to accept the help because it was too hard to endure any longer.

Reina watched them with a bitter smile.

'So that's what it was.'

At first, she didn't understand how they could ignore each other's feelings and be friends.

But now she seemed to know. The two were intertwined with a strong trust that transcended emotion.

'I can't... ever take that place.'

"She's an amazing girl."

Armin came up next to Reina. He also thought Amy was holding up well.

The hostility of the avatar is 100 percent reliable in terms of pure emotion. Yet she sacrificed herself for Shirone, which was not something an ordinary girl could do.

A cheerful smile finally bloomed on Reina's lips.

"Because she endured it for a year."

&nbsp;Shirone's mind 3rd stage.

It was a world of extreme cold.

In the midst of a cold that seemed to freeze even blood, Shirone's party crossed the frozen sea with their shoulders hunched.

There was no sun, but the ground reflected moonlight and they could see ahead.

But all that lay before them was a bleak darkness.

Amy imagined that this would be the night of the Arctic.

It was so cold and lonely, and on the other hand, mysterious enough to be a sleeping place of extreme cold.

From time to time, something as tall as a person passed by their side. It was a crystal.

Each had a different color and emitted a faint light like a plant.

"Love. Friendship. Desire."

Armin said.

"Maybe they are jewels that contain such primal emotions. We can't access them unless we approach them directly. They're dealing with unconsciousness as if it were consciousness. You don't have to worry."

Amy sighed with relief.

She didn't touch her inner emotions, so she wouldn't be embarrassed when she met Shirone again.

Of course, that would be the case when they got out of here alive.

They were going down deeper, but Armin felt like he knew less about Shirone.

Even looking at the 3rd stage alone, it was a landscape that was impossible without defining and defining everything inside oneself.

'How deep is this child's insight?'

As he thought so, the lights of the crystals began to go out one by one. Shirone looked like she was dying any minute now.

Amy didn't look back at Shirone.

She wouldn't want to show it.

She just moved forward without even wiping away her tears.

The weight of the avatar was so light that it could no longer be called human.

'Just hold on a little longer, Shirone...'

Shirone glared at the darkness in the midst of her hard time moving one step forward.

Finally, the curtain of darkness lifted and a small cabin with lights on came out.

"That's it. The second stage of depth."

Everyone knew by now.

Armin moved his frozen legs quickly and explained.

"We've penetrated the mental world in the shortest distance. We might have caught up with Arius by now. Be prepared for any situation."

It meant to get into battle mode.

Amy started warming up her mind with a formula from then on.

Reina also took out an arrow covered with frost and leaned against the wall next to the door with it on her bowstring.

The three of them left the library and searched the rest of the cabin for clues. They found a kitchen, a bathroom, a bedroom, and a basement. None of them had anything that could help them imprint something on Siroene's mind.

"Maybe we're looking at this the wrong way," Armin suggested. "Maybe we don't need to write something down. Maybe we just need to make him feel something."

"Feel something?" Reyna echoed. "Like what?"

"Like love, or fear, or pain. Something that would trigger his deepest memories and emotions."

Armin looked at Amy, who was holding Siroene's hand on the sofa.

"You're the closest to him, Amy. You should know what he cares about the most."

Amy blushed and looked away.

"I don't know what you're talking about. We're just friends."

Reyna rolled her eyes.

"Friends don't look at each other like that, Amy. You have feelings for him, and he has feelings for you. Why don't you admit it?"

Amy felt her heart pounding in her chest.

She wanted to deny it, but she knew it was true.

She had always admired Siroene for his intelligence, his talent, his kindness.

She had always enjoyed spending time with him, studying with him, competing with him.

She had always felt a special connection with him, a bond that no one else could understand.

She loved him.

But she was afraid to say it.

She was afraid of being rejected, of ruining their friendship, of losing him forever.

She was afraid of what would happen if he died.

She looked at Siroene's pale face, his closed eyes, his shallow breaths.

He was fading away, slowly but surely.

She didn't have much time left to tell him how she felt.

She didn't have much time left to save him.

She gathered her courage and leaned closer to his ear.

"Siroene," she whispered softly. "Can you hear me?"
[Translated block]
She felt a hand on her shoulder. It was Armin, who had been silent until now.

"Come on, Amy. We have to go. There's no time to waste."

He tried to pull her away from the table, but she resisted.

"No, wait. There must be something here. Something that can help us save Shiro."

She flipped through the pages of the notebook again, hoping to find a clue or a hint.

But all she saw was her name, over and over again.

Shiro's obsession with her was evident in every line.

She wondered why he felt that way. Why he hated her so much.

She wondered if she could have done something differently. If she could have prevented this tragedy.

She wondered if he ever loved her at all.

She shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts.

This was not the time for regrets or doubts.

She had to focus on the present. On the only chance they had to escape this nightmare.

She looked at Armin, who was staring at her with a worried expression.

"Armin, do you trust me?"

He nodded without hesitation.

"Of course I do. You're my friend, Amy."

She smiled faintly and grabbed his hand.

"Then follow me. I have an idea."

She ran out of the room, dragging him along.

She hoped she was right. She hoped it was not too late.

```
Even if I die here, I had to think of a way for Shirone to live.

'No! I don't know! What should I do?'

But reality is different from the mental world.

What can't be done can't be done.

Reina and Armin are not fools.

They know that it is physically impossible, so aren't they looking for a way for someone else to survive first?

Amy's hand holding the pen on the table trembled. Every second that passed was cursed.
