The people in the restaurant turned their heads to Lian.

He was the hottest topic in the vicinity, as he was a knight of Maha, but they also sensed something from the characteristics of the great sword he wore and his blue hair.

"Could they both be impostors? Or maybe one of them is real."

It wasn't an absurd thing that there was a real one among them, as it wasn't far from Rapne village.

"But that young man said it himself, he's not a knight of Maha."

The man who claimed to be a knight of Maha was flustered by the lukewarm reaction of the people.

And he realized that the cause was the young man who was lucky enough to have blue hair and wore a great sword, and approached him.

"Hey, you. Do you think it's funny that I'm a knight of Maha? What are you doing spitting out what you ate and making a fuss?"

"Maha's knight?"

Lian asked back, and the man shouted as if it was an opportunity.

"Yes, I'm the rising star, Maha's knight Lian!"

'That's what it is.'

Lian also knew how many fake names were sold while wandering around the world.

Of course, he never imagined that someone would impersonate his name, which was nothing but unknown.

"You're Lian. Then what's your last name?"

The eyes of the people shone with curiosity, as the family of Maha's knight was hidden behind a veil, only rumors were rampant.

"Do you want to know that much? Fine! I'll tell you today! I'm Lian of Ryan! Ryan Lian!"

Someone among the guests pretended to know.

"I knew it. Well, you have to be at least Ryan to get the title of Maha's knight."

The Ryan family was one of the seven clans called 7 Swords in Biden Kingdom, and they had a cheerful swordsmanship like the Ogent family.

'Ryan family...'

Lian put down his utensils and stood up.

It was impossible for a great swordsman of such a great family to impersonate someone else's name, but even if it was true, it was unacceptable for someone else to use one of the names representing the family.

"You're not Lian. The swordsman named Lian has blue hair and is nineteen years old, and uses a straight sword instead of a saw blade. And his last name is Ogent. One of the oldest swordsmanship families in Torumia Kingdom."

As Lian said something strange, the man flinched.

'What is this kid?'

His real name was Alf.

He was a bandit leader who had been betrayed by his subordinates and dreamed of making a name for himself as a knight.

"Don't talk nonsense! Do you think you can fool me by mentioning the name of another country? And how do you know that?"

Lian approached him, scratching his blue hair.

"Because I'm Lian."

"Ha ha! You're Lian? What? Lian!"

Alf's eyes widened.

"Yes, Lian. I don't know if he's a knight of Maha or something, but anyway, I'm Lian. So if you want to make your name known, fight for yourself or find out someone else's name."

Alf didn't expect to meet the real one in this place and cold sweat ran down his back.

'No, it's not certain yet. I'm also cheating around, so why can't this guy be a cheater? The hair can be dyed, and that sword...'

He had lived by swinging his sword in his own way, so Alf couldn't lie in front of <Idea>'s true value.

It was an object with no shine and a crude shape, but he intuitively felt its abnormality that could not even scratch its teeth, let alone scratch it.

"Hey guys, so who's the real Lian?"

"Maybe they're both fake? That would be really funny! Hahaha!"

The situation where they both claimed to be Lian was ridiculous regardless of the truth, and the atmosphere in the restaurant changed like a circus.

'This damn...'

He could be a cheater too, but he could also be real, and somehow he felt like this guy was real.

'Don't make me laugh. Give up here?'

Alf's head flashed through the days.

The rising star of the swordsmanship world, the knight of Maha, Lian.

When he was a mere bandit, he didn't receive the awe of the people, the unknown swordsmen who came to seek friendship, and especially the treatment in the pleasure district was the best.

'How did I get here?'

What he realized while living as a knight of Maha was that in the end, the world was all about reputation.

Even with the same skill, the one with fame would teach his subordinates in a safe place, and the unknown swordsman would wander around the battlefield and have his neck cut by the general's sword. That was the way of the world.

"Shut up! I'm a knight of Maha! I'm Lian!"

Alf decided to gamble on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

He would break this fresh young man here and become a true knight of Maha.

"Calm down. I'm not trying to fight you. You don't even have to apologize. Just go back and don't use the name Lian from now on. Isn't that it?"

Alf couldn't accept it.

If he did this, it would look like the real and fake were really decided.

"No! I'm the real one! If you want to use the name Lian, you'll have to kill me. Why, are you afraid? Avoiding a fight is proof that you're fake!"

Some people nodded their heads as if to show off.

They had some reason, and they were sorry that he wanted to end it with words instead of fists.

200 meters away from the restaurant where Lian was.

Miro was eating a spicy chicken skewer, a specialty of Biden, at a stall on the street selling local products.

Her outfit had evolved every time she crossed the border.

She had braided her hair and lifted it up like a sheep, exposing her entire neckline, and wore a robe much larger than her body shape, with red letters on both arms.

"Ah, spicy. But this is really delicious."

"......Where are you from?"

The stall owner was curious about her strange appearance, but she was so beautiful that he just found it interesting.

"I've been everywhere. Oh, give me one more of these."

The stall owner handed over a chicken skewer that he had just cooked.

"Take your time. If you eat too much, your stomach might hurt."

"It's okay. I've eaten snakes in the desert."

"It's a fight! There's a fight in the restaurant alley!"

Then a man ran past Miro's back shouting.

"The knight of Maha has appeared! Hurry up before you miss a good show!"

The stall owner looked at the crowd and said.

"That's amazing. The knight of Maha came here. If it wasn't for my shop, I'd go see it too."

"Do you know him too, sir? The knight of Maha?"

"I know him. He annihilated the Red Spear bandits, not to mention defeated Lambdas. The rumor has already spread to Biden's capital. What was his name, Lian or something?"

"Hmm."

Miro turned her head toward the restaurant alley and gulped down half of the chicken skewer left in her mouth.

"Swing over there! Scrape it off with a saw blade! Hey, when that happens, you have to wrestle! Close the gap!"

When Miro arrived in front of the restaurant, a wall of people had already formed an arena.

The guards would disperse as soon as they arrived, so they seemed to be enjoying themselves with their souls on fire.

She squeezed in and saw that the situation of the battle was quite strange.

While the hairy giant swung his menacing weapon, the blue-haired youth held his sword but showed no intention of counterattack.

"Hey, what are you doing! Fight! Are you scared? If this goes on, the saw blade sword will be confirmed as Lian!"

The spectators tried their best to provoke him, but Lian didn't even pretend to listen.

His heartburn disappeared completely as he annihilated the Red Spear bandits, and whether he cut or not was something only he could decide.

'Why do you want to fight so badly? Do you need to make a fuss over this?'

Lian had swung his sword without hesitation at anyone who pointed his sword at him until now, but he wasn't particularly fond of it.
[Translated block]


"It doesn't seem like a fight."

That was the key.

It was because he didn't feel any threat from the sword that his opponent swung.

"It changed after I cut down 100 people."

He didn't feel tense, so he had room to spare, and that's why he could see properly.

"You've gotten stronger."

Lian, who finally realized his change, tasted a brief joy even in the moment of battle.

"You bastard!"

Alf, who felt it as a mockery, rushed in with his saw blade sword raised to the sky.

When Lian came to his senses, he was already down to 30 centimeters from the saw blade.

If it was before, his heart would have sunk, but now Lian was seeing properly.

"It's still okay. There's about a foot of room left."

Lian, who had denied inertia, twisted his upper body as if bouncing back, and bang! The saw blade sword struck the ground.

"What? Wasn't that weird?"

The spectators stirred.

They felt as if the scenery around them was distorted when Lian dodged the attack.

Miro's eyes sparkled.

'He's good.'

That was the end of his judgment.

"You bastard......!"

Alf bared his teeth like a wolf, but his legs were slowly retreating.

Axing, which changes the rhythm of the body, betrays the future situation that humans expect through learning.

That gap causes an illusion in the eyes, but people who don't know can only feel like they are enchanted by magic.

"I found you, Lian."

Then Miro entered the duel place and Alf frowned unpleasantly and said.

"If you want to be friends with Mahas Knight, come later. The duel is not over yet."

"No, it's over. I'll tell you who's pretending to be fake."

"What? You little......"

He said that, but he couldn't outright refuse because he secretly had expectations.

After all, if it's a 50/50 chance, he could also point to himself, right?

But contrary to his hopes, Miro pointed to Alf's face without even needing to think.

"The fake is you."

As much as he was pricked by his conscience, Alf freaked out.

"What! Don't talk nonsense! Do you have any evidence that I'm fake?"

"Of course I do. From what I heard, Mahas Knight wiped out a bandit group to save a threatened mother and daughter. There's no way such a cool person would look like you. Therefore, you're not. No, you can't be."

Alf's eyes lost reason.

"This damn girl!"

And at the moment he stabbed his saw blade sword vertically down, Lian hugged Miro and swung his sword.

"Oh my."

Bang! As the two swords collided for the first time, Alf was startled by the overwhelming strength that transcended common sense.

"Crazy......!"

He pushed away the great sword with both hands with one hand.

"Are you okay?"

Lian looked back at Miro and asked.

"Yes, thank you. You're really kind, Mahas Knight."

"Please go outside. It is an insult to the honor of a swordsman for a third party to enter the duel place without permission."

Miro's smile disappeared as he pretended to be a ladylike lady.

"You're Lian, Shirona's friend. You have to come with me now."

Lian's face turned pale as if he had been struck by lightning.

"Do you know Shirona? What's going on?"

"I need your help. Are you going or not?"

As if there was no need to hesitate, Lian attached his great sword to his back and signaled that he was ready to leave.

"I'll go. Where is she now?"

'Phew, she's much easier than Marsha.'

He still had a headache when he thought of the conversation he had with Marsha, who was full of doubt and interrogated him all day long.

"This damn girl is ignoring me!"

Alf ran after Miro's back.

He was the leader of the bandit group, so he didn't care about gender or age.

"I'll grind your face with a saw!"

Miro's eyes cooled down as he felt his murderous intent.

He gently pushed Lian's chest away and turned around. At that moment, a figure of Avalokitesvara appeared in her halo.

As if separated from the world, Alph has a strange experience as the relativity of time is activated.

In the mind of the Scale Mage, space-time is split to the extreme, and his palm spreads like a fan along the trajectory of his arm moving down.

The saw blade sword fits perfectly into Miro's palms, and then countless palms of Guanyin push in one after another, compressing the power.

Dududududu!

Just by pressing from both sides, the thick blade wobbled like rubber, and finally the iron handle shattered like glass, spreading shock waves.

"Ahhhh!"

Screaming and falling, Alph found smoke rising from between Miro's palms and looked blankly.

When she opened her palms, a reddish iron plate in the shape of a palm fell with a clanging sound.

"This, this is..."

It was completely compressed like a film, and the iron that had lost its heat was charred black.

Lian shook her hand in ecstasy and looked at Miro approaching with a dumbfounded expression.

"What are you..."

As if nothing had happened, Miro smiled with her eyes and pushed Lian's back.

"Let's go. I'll explain on the way."

That's how the last puzzle for the hell trip was completed.
