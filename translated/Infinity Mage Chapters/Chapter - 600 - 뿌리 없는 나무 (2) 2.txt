[600] Tree Without Roots (2)

* * *

Shirone, who woke up from sleep, couldn't get out of bed until after noon.

"Gepin……."

The words he left behind were circling in her head like a puzzle.

"I have to go."

Shirone, who got up, finished washing and found the Supernatural Spirit Science Laboratory.

When she took a deep breath and cast a time bomb, the time machine whirled and blew up the barrier of time.

The noisy sound of the upper floor was no longer heard.

'It's closed.'

Since Miro came out into the world, Hexa couldn't be the material of the barrier, and therefore, the upper floor also had no meaning to exist.

'He's gone.'

When she thought that Gepin had completely left, Shirone, who fell into a sense of emptiness, sat down on the sofa.

'I have no cause.'

It felt like she was left alone in the universe.

"Shirone, what happened?"

Amy and Iruki came in.

"Huh? Is the evaluation over already?"

"The evaluation time is a mess. Because of the Scramble Royale."

Unless Nade returns, the alliance team was in a situation where they had to give up.

"I came here because I wasn't in the dormitory. What the hell happened? When I asked the patrol, he told me to hear it directly."

"That's right, the patrol?"

"He's gone. He dropped out."

"I see."

She had expected it.

"Now tell me. You promised."

"That's……."

Shirone told everything that happened in the upper floor without omission.

There had been no secrets so far, so the understanding was quick, and in the solemn atmosphere, Amy made a sad expression.

'Poor Shirone.'

She decided to go to heaven, giving up even the dream of a wizard to find her roots, but this is how the conclusion came out.

"I have no roots. I don't know what it is, but I don't want to know. It's a terrible feeling."

"There is no result without a cause. Even if it's a perfect coincidence, your meaning doesn't disappear."

Amy added to Iruki's words.

"That's right, Shirone. There must be a reason. Gepin also used the word 'once'. Don't give up from the start."

Thinking that she had talked too darkly, Shirone changed the atmosphere.

"But what about Nade? Don't tell me he hasn't returned yet?"

"He probably feels responsible for leaving the Scramble Royale. He'll need some more time."

"As long as he doesn't come back, the alliance team will have to give up."

"I came here because I wasn't in the dormitory. What the hell happened? When I asked the patrol, he told me to hear it directly."

"That's right, the patrol?"

"He's gone. He dropped out."

"I see."

Drunk on alcohol, she became pregnant with Nade and thus became a member of the West family, but it was like getting on a sinking ship.

"How pathetic."

The house was going bankrupt, but the head of the household, Bolrum, was still soaked in alcohol and play and did not even come home.

Even if she screamed at him to somehow save the business, Teria, who was embraced by a night of fire play, only pretended to be annoyed.

"The young master is crying again."

At the nanny's words, she threw the comb she was combing her hair on the floor.

"Then keep him quiet! That's why you're here!"

"But once he starts crying......"

"I'm annoyed!"

Teria pushed the nanny and went over to Nade's room.

"Mom! Mom!"

When she saw her son crying like a fool with his mouth wide open, she thought of her pathetic husband and her hair stood on end.

"Why......!"

Teria screamed as if her throat was going to burst.

"Why are you crying! Why are you crying! I'm doing everything I can by breaking down what I don't have! What are you dissatisfied with!"

"Strange sound... sound......"

"You idiot? Why are you so stupid to bother me!"

Contrary to Teria's misunderstanding, Nade was suffering from overflow after realizing some principle of the world.

Nade was only three years old at the time.

"Mom. Mom."

Teria, whose anger had reached the top of her head, distorted her face horribly and slapped Nade's cheek hard.

With the physical shock, the child was able to hold back his crying for a moment, and this method was Teria's only means until Nade's mind was completely destroyed.

"Heuk!"

Nade, who sat up abruptly, quickly looked around and sighed with relief.

"Phew, thank goodness."

The fact that the lightning was not discharged meant that control was beginning to be restored, but his heart was still miserable.

'I should start going back.'

Since he had left the Scramble Royal, he had no face to see his friends.

"I need to wash up first."

When he arrived in the city after coming down the mountain, the sun was rising, and Nade went into a public bathhouse and melted the hardship of camping.

There weren't many people, but they all glanced at Nade's body.

The burn marks all over his body were the traces of torture by the infamous Chicken Head Thieves.

He should have died, but Nade killed his mind to save his body.

"The scar is still......"

The nail marks he had carved himself were still left on the face reflected in the mirror.

The scab had peeled off, but it seemed to take a little more time to heal completely.

'Anyway, I can control it, so I should stay at the inn from today.'

Nade, who had no intention of returning to school yet, was still there.

* * *

"Nothing. Where the hell did he go?"

Shirone, who had been wandering around the city of Creas all day, sat on the roof of someone else's house and sighed.

There were many people passing by on the street, but those who were tired of life seemed to have no leisure to look up at the sky.

It may not be possible to turn the entire city in a day, but it didn't seem impossible to expand the Spirit Zone in a state of impregnable defense.

"Did he really go into the mountains?"

Then there would be no way to find him anyway, so it would be better to look around the city a little more.

Shirone, who spread out the light and flew up, observed the ground with the eyes of a hawk through the nerve enhancement of Arman.

"Huh?"

And finally, he found Nade coming out of the bathhouse about three blocks away.

"Not even an old man......"

Shirone, who lost his appetite, flew straight into the sky and landed on the roof of a commercial building.

As soon as the tentacles hit the ground lightly, his body spun around, and when he fell down, he was already in a state of disarming Arman.

As soon as he landed on the ground with a nimble movement, people were surprised and backed away.

"What, what? Is it a circus?"

At the murmuring sound, Nade, who turned around, stiffened his face.

"Ha ha! I found it!"

"Shirone?"

Nade, who frowned, bowed his head and started running away before Shirone could speak.
[Translated block]


"Hey! Why are you running away?"

Shirone, who had been staring blankly, immediately flew off.

"Shirone! Don't follow me!"

"Why are you running away then?"

"I don't know! Just leave me alone!"

Despite being hit by the crowd and tripping over the goods on the left, the two did not stop.

'Anyway, he's persistent.'

Nade, who knew about Shirone's stubbornness, cast a teleportation spell and flew into the sky.

"Kyaa!"

The passersby were surprised, and a few merchants pointed to the sky and shouted.

"He's a wizard! That's definitely magic!"

It was a daily occurrence for students of the magic school, but most people had no chance to see magic in their lifetime.

"That's......!"

Shirone, who had raised his head, gritted his teeth.

Nade had calculated that he would not be able to cast magic in front of people, but Shirone, who had already heard from Iruki, did not give up this time either.

"Stop there! Just you wait till I catch you!"

As the flash soared, the street's economic activity stopped, and everyone looked up at the sky as if time had stopped.

Nade shouted at Shirone, who was chasing him closely.

"Ugh! Are you crazy? What if someone reports this to the school!"

"Why are you running away? Let's talk for a moment!"

'It's a big deal. He's serious.'

Nade, who knew about Shirone's movement skills, swallowed his saliva imagining the future where he would be caught.

"Don't make me laugh! I'll show you my real skills!"

One minute later.

"Ugh!"

Nade, who was caught by Shirone, fell in the middle of the market and rolled on the ground.

"Come here!"

"Save me!"

His freshly bathed body was covered in dust, but Nade crawled on the ground.

However, he was eventually caught by Shirone and pushed against the wall.

"It's over! Give up!"

As Shirone's face approached, Nade quickly turned his head.

He couldn't bear to show his face.

"Look at me! Don't turn your head!"

"No."

"This is real!"

When Shirone changed his position and leaned in, Nade's neck went back to the other side.

While the actions of the person trying to avoid eye contact and the person trying to make eye contact were repeated, murmurs were heard from the surroundings.

"What are they doing since morning? They're so manly."

"Wait a minute, aren't they both men?"

Nade, whose face turned red, shook off Shirone's arm that was leaning on his shoulder and shouted.

"Hey! Let go of this! You're making me misunderstood because of you!"

"Why are you running away? Did you do something wrong?"

Nade, who had been blustering for a while, suddenly made a sad face and bowed his head.

"I'm sorry, Shirone. I messed everything up. It was me who dragged you guys into this."

"What are you talking about? You fought your best. I heard from Iruki. Besides, you won the Scramble Royal."

It was a relief for Nade, but it made him feel more guilty.

"Ha, I should have been there."

"Everyone is worried. Let's go back to school for now."

Meanwhile, a man and a woman who had just arrived in the city were stunned by the spectacle that had taken place in broad daylight.

"What's all the fuss about since a while ago?"

The blond man was handsome and tall, and next to him was a woman with the sophistication of a capital bashka, crossing her arms.

"They say there's a wizard or something in that block. They say he's still a kid."

"Then is he a student? Alpheus Magic School."

At the man's words, the woman smiled.

"Maybe."

"I see. The management of the students is a mess in the countryside. It's impossible in the capital."

The woman rolled her eyes.

"Are you insulting my alma mater now?"

"Haha! Is that so?"

"Anyway, let's go. I'm curious. Maybe you know? Maybe we can meet a junior we know."

"I'm busy, but just go......!"

As the woman hugged the man's arm and moved her steps, the man had no choice but to follow her with a sour taste in his mouth.

"Hehe, what kind of kids are they..."

The woman who arrived through the crowd was surprised to see the two boys arguing fiercely.

"Huh?"

"Why? Do you know them?"

The man asked while yawning, but she didn't even reply and approached them.

"Nade! You're Nade, right?"

Nade, who turned his head at the sound of his name, stood still with a shocked expression.

"Riz... senior?"

"Wow! You're really Nade? It's been a long time!"

"How did you get here, senior?"

Aeple Riz.

She was the former president of the Supernatural Spirit Science Research Association and Nade's first love who pulled him out of hell.
