[257] The truth revealed (2)

"By the way, today is the publication date. Did our school's story come out well?"

Olivia asked as she received the magazine.

As she said our school from her mouth, Alpheus smiled contentedly.

But the good atmosphere disappeared as soon as he saw the cover.

There was a shocking content written on the headline article.

&nbsp;Shock! Interview with Sirone's parents!

&nbsp;The student who defeated Dante is a child of a woodcutter?

Olivia tilted her head.

Sirone's parents' interview, not Sirone. And what does it mean by a child of a woodcutter?

Klein was a bitter woman, but she was not foolish enough to post a distorted article that made no sense.

Cold sweat ran down Alpheus's spine.

It was not a distorted article, but a fact.

Currently, only a few people in the school knew Sirone's origin.

Of course, if Klein decided to track down his identity, it would be very easy to find out. The parents of Sirone had no chance to resist the interview skills of a pro correspondent.

Olivia opened the magazine and read the article quickly.

The process of Sirone subduing Dante was detailed and even had pictures.

He heard that Obscura had broken, but it was clear that it was a lie.

But the article was not a lie.

Distortion also has a degree, and if she wrote such an article with fabrication, it would have been expulsion without saying anything.

'Is it true? Sirone is... a child of a woodcutter?'

Olivia looked back at Alpheus as if asking for an explanation.

Alpheus nodded his head with a bitter expression.

"It's true. Sirone is a child of a woodcutter. But he was admitted by special admission with the recommendation of the Ogent family. Even the teachers don't know. Sade didn't know either."

Olivia showed her resentment.

"I don't care about that. Why did you hide it from me? At least I, the principal, should have known."

Alpheus also had an unfair part.

He knew better than anyone that Olivia was a careful and tight-lipped person. The problem was that he didn't expect this to happen.

"I didn't hide it or keep it in my head. It's been a year already, and no one was curious about Sirone's origin."

As Alpheus said with a sad face, Olivia also stopped blaming him and thought.

Sirone's personality definitely had a unique side. If you hang out with him, you don't care much about his origin.

But anything can happen where many people gather.

"Anyway, I'm naive. No matter how many allies Sirone has, there are bound to be students who envy him. You should always be thinking about it. If I knew, this wouldn't have happened in the first place."

Alpheus had nothing to say this time.

He was excellent at taking care of students, but he had no talent for politics.

Olivia crossed her arms and pondered, then made a decision.

"Mr. Sade."

"Yes, Principal."

"Call Klein right now. Tell her to come to me as soon as she gets permission. If she doesn't come within 24 hours, I'll go find her myself."

"I understand."

Sade bowed his head and turned around.

@

As Sirone's origin was revealed, Alpheus Magic School turned upside down.

The teachers were also shocked, but of course the ones who talked were the students.

Olivia's prediction was accurate.

It seemed like everyone liked Sirone, but there were clearly a minority of students who couldn't express their opinions swept away by the flow of the masses. They were the ones who envied Sirone's talent.

And when this incident happened, they started to sell Sirone like fish in water.

The school cafeteria was crowded with students after class.

There was also plenty of time because the advanced class practice test was over, but the library was not suitable for talking about Sirone, who was an issue right now.

Especially the group of middle-class students in Class 4 who occupied the corner table were passionately cutting down Sirone as if they were paid to do so.

“Hey, Dante. What’s going on with you? You don’t seem like yourself.”

Dante looked up from his coffee and met Closer’s eyes.

“What do you mean?”

Closer leaned forward and lowered his voice.

“You know what I mean. You lost to Siroine, the biggest loser in this school. And you act like nothing happened. Don’t you have any pride?”

Dante shrugged and took another sip of his coffee.

“Pride? What’s the point of pride? It doesn’t change anything.”

Closer was stunned by Dante’s words. He had always admired Dante for his confidence and ambition. He had always followed Dante’s lead and supported him in everything. He had always believed that Dante was destined for greatness.

But now, Dante seemed to have lost his fire. He seemed to have given up on his dreams.

Closer felt a surge of anger and frustration.

“Dante, you can’t be serious. You can’t let Siroine get away with this. He humiliated you in front of everyone. He made you look like a fool. He stole your glory.”

Dante shook his head and smiled bitterly.

“Glory? What glory? There’s no glory in this school. There’s no glory in this world. It’s all a lie.”

Closer felt a chill run down his spine. He had never heard Dante talk like this before.

“Dante, what are you saying? You sound like you’ve gone crazy.”

Dante looked at Closer with a calm and detached expression.

“No, Closer. I’m not crazy. I’m just awake.”

He put down his coffee and stood up.

“I’m sorry, Closer. But I have to go. There’s something I need to do.”

He turned around and walked away, leaving Closer speechless and confused.

Closer watched him go, feeling a mix of emotions.

He wanted to stop him, to ask him what he was planning to do, to convince him to change his mind.

But he also felt a sense of fear, a sense of dread.

He had a bad feeling about this.

He wondered if he would ever see Dante again.

** What? You knew? How come you never told us?

**Iruki:** It's not something we had to tell anyone. It's Siro's personal matter. Besides, it doesn't change anything. He's still the same person we've known for years.

**James:** How can you say that? He lied to you! He deceived you! He pretended to be someone he's not!

**Iruki:** No, he didn't. He never claimed to be a noble. He never acted superior or arrogant. He never looked down on anyone. He just wanted to study and learn.

**James:** Study and learn? Ha! Don't make me laugh. He only wanted to show off his skills and humiliate you. He wanted to prove that he's better than you, better than all of us.

**Iruki:** That's not true. Siro is not like that. He's humble and kind. He always helped me when I was stuck on a problem. He always encouraged me when I was feeling down. He always shared his knowledge and insights with me.

**James:** Oh, please. Stop being so naive. He only did those things to manipulate you, to gain your trust, to use you as a pawn. He never cared about you as a friend. He only saw you as a tool.

**Iruki:** Enough! You don't know anything about Siro or me. You're just jealous and bitter because he beat you fair and square. You can't accept the fact that he's smarter and stronger than you, even though he's a commoner.

**James:** How dare you! You're the one who's jealous and bitter. You're the one who can't accept the fact that he betrayed you, even though he's your friend.

**Iruki:** Betrayed me? How did he betray me? By being born in a different class? By having a different talent? By having a different dream? That's not betrayal, that's diversity.

**James:** Diversity? Don't give me that crap. This is not a place for diversity. This is a place for hierarchy. This is a place for order. This is a place for nobles.

**Iruki:** No, this is a place for students. This is a place for learning. This is a place for growth. This is a place for everyone.

**James:** Everyone? Don't be ridiculous. There's no such thing as everyone. There's only us and them. There's only nobles and commoners. There's only winners and losers.

**Iruki:** And which one are you?

**James:** I'm a winner, of course.

**Iruki:** Really? Then why are you so afraid of Siro?

**James:** I'm not afraid of him!

**Iruki:** Then why are you so obsessed with him?

**James:** I'm not obsessed with him!

**Iruki:** Then why are you so angry with him?

**James:** I'm not angry with him!

**Iruki:** Then what are you?

**James:** I'm... I'm...

He couldn't find the words to answer.

He realized that he didn't know himself anymore.

He realized that he had lost his way.

He realized that he had wasted his time.

He realized that he had missed his chance.

He realized that he had nothing left.

He felt a surge of emotions in his chest.

He felt frustration, resentment, regret, shame, despair.

He felt like crying, screaming, hitting, running, hiding.

He felt like giving up.

But he couldn't do any of those things.

He couldn't show any weakness.

He couldn't admit any defeat.

He couldn't face any reality.

So he did the only thing he could do.

He turned around and walked away.

"What, what?"

James opened his mouth in disbelief.

It was possible that Shirone, who was always with him as one of the three musketeers, had said it. But how could he be friends with him knowing that?
