[248] System Operation (1)

The sound of the wind was replaced by silence.

The students were speechless. In just five minutes, Dante, who was called the best talent in the kingdom, had been brought to his knees by Siro's storm-like offensive.

"What? Is this real? That Dante...?"

A student jumped up and shouted.

"Siro knocked him down! He knocked down Dante!"

Then, as if it was planned, the training ground number 2000 was filled with cheers.

"It was too one-sided, right? He didn't stand a chance from the start, did he?"

"Dante couldn't do anything against Siro. I knew from the beginning that Siro would win!"

The students threw in their comments. Dante's defense was rated as the best among all the students of the kingdom's magic school. It was natural that they were excited to see him fall without even being able to properly counter Siro's attacks.

Once a defensive wall is breached, won't it be breached again?

The duel was not over yet, but judging from the battle so far, it seemed that Siro had already gained the upper hand.

As countless emotions boiled over, a hot fighting spirit soared high into the sky. The only ones who kept their cool were Alpheus and Olivia, the hidden protagonists of this duel.

It was an unexpected development for both of them. Olivia didn't expect Dante to fall so easily, and Alpheus was surprised by Siro's aggressive offensive.

But this was the world of magic. No, not just magic, but all kinds of competition in the world are relative.

"Magicians are..."

Alpheus carefully chose his words as if he was defining something important.

"Unhuman humans."

"..."

Olivia kept silent. There was nothing to say to him when Dante took a hit.

"Most humans can't even enter the spirit realm. Once you enter the magic school, you can be considered to have transcended the realm of mortals."

Olivia's eyes became fierce. If she reversed Alpheus's words, it meant that even Dante was nothing more than a magic school student.

"So what? Dante hasn't lost yet."

Alpheus ignored her and continued.

"But... when you gather those who have surpassed humanity, a very interesting phenomenon occurs. Among them, someone else transcends again. They compete at a higher level, and from there, someone else stands out."

Contrary to Olivia's expectation, Alpheus didn't say those words to belittle Dante. He was reflecting on his own life through the duel of the two students who had transcended mortals.

"And at the end of climbing up, there is no more room to go up. Isn't that the realm of a first-class grand magician?"

Alpheus smiled and looked at Olivia. She had a sullen expression on her face, lost in thought. She looked cute for her age.

Olivia finally opened her mouth.

"...Are you ignoring me now because I'm second-class?"

Alpheus didn't answer and turned his head to number 2000.

How could he ignore a second-class grand magician?

But if he thought about it... there was no one among the magicians who had reached that position who was satisfied with their place.

Once they entered the realm of grand magicians, anyone would run towards first-class.

They just couldn't make it.

Students, pros, second-class grand magicians... they couldn't avoid competition.

They had to fight a lonely battle for their whole lives to take one more step forward in the pool they belonged to.

That was the world of magic.

Alpheus also dreamed of becoming a first-class grand magician when he was young.

He didn't know what the future would bring, but there was a time when he expected himself to become one with almost certainty.

But he lost his wife Erina and wandered for 10 years during which his ambition disappeared.

If he had started again from then on, could he have become a first-class magician?

But the shame that was engraved in his heart was considerable.

It was the first time he had been downed so quickly in a fight with someone, even if it wasn't serious.

'2 seconds. 1 second. That's it.'

Dante finally got out of the shock and slowly got up. It was an unbelievable thing, but it might have been a natural result when he thought about it.

He didn't let his guard down. But the fear of tension was more terrifying than that, and it took away his quick judgment.

Whatever it is, it's the most scary before it happens. As long as he felt Shiro's ability with his body, there would never be such a vain fall as now.

"Give me some praise. You're one of the few in the whole kingdom who pushed me this far. I'll put you in the top 20 or so."

Shiro didn't say anything. He didn't even notice Dante's arrogant attitude of ranking among the same students.

It was a full-scale offensive in the state of opening the immortal function. Honestly, he thought the duel was over. But he didn't fall. That fact made Shiro angry.

Dante adjusted his spirit zone and said.

"But from now on, it's going to be different. You better be prepared..."

"Dante."

Shiro cut off his words as if he didn't need to hear any more.

He had to pull him up a little more. He needed a formidable force that Dante could never stand up to.

As Shiro turned into a flash and approached him, Dante felt his heart drop and hastily cast teleportation.

He barely avoided Shiro's biting teeth and brushed his chest. It seemed that he would have collided if he had retreated a little later.

Did he want annihilation? No, he must have expected this reaction.

Shiro still had the initiative in the battle.

'But I'll turn it around here.'

As Dante changed direction after repeated retreats, Shiro's flash also sharply bent its angle and chased him.

Two flashes of light adorned the sky with incredible movements within a radius of 10 meters, which was the distance of one teleportation.

The students opened their eyes wide as if they couldn't believe it. It was only a year ago that Shiro took the advancement test by teleporting from a bridge he couldn't cross.

Of course, at that time, Shiro had a record of passing through the dragon's maze, which was level 10 difficulty, but all the skills he showed now were advanced skills used by pros.

Dante also used the same level of skills, but he was a major who had been training steadily at the Royal Magic School since he was young.

In other words, Shiro's growth rate was too fast. They even wondered if his time flowed differently from others.

"When did he reach such a level...?"

Mark muttered as Shiro and Dante rushed towards each other at the same time.

The students' minds stopped at the same point.

Shiro and Dante probably didn't know that each other would choose to rush. But neither of them thought of avoiding it.

It was a chicken game where both would lose their lives if one didn't give up.

The two flashes of light locked on the horizon. The students closed their eyes tightly, thinking it was over, when the two people turned in different directions at exactly the same time from the center of the horizon.

Mark couldn't measure with his eyes who dodged first. Even in the chicken game, they were tied.

"Is their magical sense equal?"

Iruki admired with pure heart. Although he was downed once, Dante's movement was worthy of being called the best in the kingdom.

Shiro and Dante were chasing each other's illusions.

Their eyelids were fixed as if they were hard and their pupils were sucking in everything in their sight.

Even while exerting concentration beyond human limits, Shiro licked his tongue at Dante's defense.

'His defensive sense is really amazing. There's no way to break through him.'

Dante's movement when he was determined to defend was like a work of art. He retreated 10 meters when he advanced 10 meters, and he escaped with the exact same distance even when he changed it to 9.8 meters.
