[473] The Movement of People (3)

Plu, who had a fractured left upper arm, could not move easily.

If the Dawkins algorithm was activated in this situation, the broken arm would shake as it pleased, and the pain would result in a loss of combat power.

Not everyone can have extreme skills like Gaold.

"Kruk!"

Plu's pride was hurt as he had to distance himself every time Raun approached.

Especially, the dull emotion of desire reflected in his eyes made her more uncomfortable.

"Huhu, as I thought."

Raun clenched both fists.

Ching! Ching!

Electricity was generated again near Piper's spine and gathered in both fists.

She couldn't avoid two electric shockwaves no matter what she did.

"You've never bowed to anyone. You would rather break than lose, and you trained yourself countless times with that determination and refined your mind."

Plu glared at Raun without answering.

Watching his every move was the only solution now that the Dawkins algorithm was sealed.

"I know that your pride made you who you are now. But do you know that there are beings of different dimensions in the world? I have gained immortality, and I will continue to enjoy this life forever."

The mechanical sound from Piper's interpreter device irritated Plu's nerves.

She felt like she could do anything if she could just break his chin.

"What do you want to say?"

"The point is, I don't hate women like you."

Raun spread his clenched fists to the left and right.

"I'll give you a choice. Be my woman. You don't have to worry about me leaving you. I'll take care of you until you grow old and die. Of course, in my way."

Plu grabbed her injured arm and backed away from Raun's casual approach.

But her eyes were cold unlike before.

There can be no regret or repentance for those who have gained immortality.

They can start over anytime, and they have eternal time to make up for any mistakes.

"I get it now."

Plu lifted her upper lip and showed her fangs.

"You are not a human being who lives forever."

"Hmm, the jealousy of a mortal..."

"You're already dead."

Raun stopped talking and lowered his eyelids.

"You're a dead man. You lack what humans need most."

"Lack? Me? What am I missing?"

"Heart."

Plu swung Phoenix with her right arm and took a fighting stance.

"You have no heart. Nothing is important because you have nothing to throw away. Only a little stimulation flowing through your wooden body is everything, right?"

Pzzt!

Electricity rose from Raun's fists.

He finally realized that he should not accept the madness of a mortal.

"Kill me. Teach me what real death is."

Raun jumped out at the same time as his words ended.

'Dawkins algorithm.'

Plu ignored her injury and spread her spirit zone again.

Raun's attack was more violent and persistent than before, but Plu's movements were also flawless now.

She didn't care if her broken arm shook as it pleased, or even if her spine broke.

What mattered to her was not the life of the future, but this moment.

That's why she could fight with everything she had.

Raun's attack, which was in harmony with the machine, was still exquisite, but Plu rushed with her life on the line.

As time passed, Raun's face hardened.

No matter how much he attacked, Plu's momentum grew bigger and eventually reached a point where her life was in danger.

The height of determination. The moment he crossed that threshold, Raun finally realized.

That he could die too.

"This... this...!"

An emotion he never wanted to admit hit Raun's chest.

Fear. And a sense of defeat.

Neither of them were things he could handle.

"Ahhhh!"

As he spat out all the electricity that had gathered in his fists to the ground, a powerful current spread in all directions.

Flu flew as if it didn't matter, and Shinmin's clothes, which were weak to heat, burned and exposed his bare skin.

'Ah, really ...! Again?'

Flu clenched his teeth.

His skin was reddened by first-degree burns, but worse than that was the current that shook his muscles.

'Krrrrrrk!'

Even in a situation where his body did not listen, he cast magic with only his willpower and approached Raun, and finally swung the phoenix.

'Phoenix strike!'

Kioooooo!

As a lava-like flaming phoenix popped out, Raun raised both arms with a terrified expression.

As his head turned pale, he couldn't even figure out how to react.

As a huge flame soared, Raun's eyes widened.

More frightening than pain is death.

He had lived for a thousand years and thought he had many more lives left than that, but the fear of his life ending at this moment was more terrifying than anything in the world.

"Ah, nooooo!"

Raun screamed.

The scream he uttered was the most miserable end that a human could make.

Flu looked at Raun calmly with eyes that seemed to have no room for pity as a senior.

He's burning.

His flesh burned away, and all that was left was a metallic piper skeleton.

In the end, it turned into another material and was absorbed by another life.

That was life.

Thud. Thump.

Flu, who had been looking at Raun's charred corpse, turned his body.

But the wound he had suffered from Raun was fatal, and as soon as he left the building with his naked body, he collapsed on the spot.

"Haah..."

The immortals were strong, but they had weaknesses commensurate with that. And Shirone must have figured out that weakness properly.

'I can't help it. I have to wait until they come to help.'

Flu looked down at his burnt thigh and stuck out his lower lip.

It was inevitable because it was during the battle, but as a senior, his dignity was not so bad.

* * *

"Eeeek!"

Dana retreated in fear with a terrified expression.

She could clearly see the blade of the tentacle aiming for her neck as much as her heart shrank.

She dies.

Her life, which had an eternal future guaranteed, ended in vain here.

Shirone no longer shrank back.

No matter how skilled they were in avatar art, they had infinitely more to lose from death than mortals.

That's why he could charge forward.

Murkawa and Dana repeated only retreats from the photon cannons spreading in all directions.

The fear of death overwhelmed them more and more, and eventually even Murka, who was Kergo's best warrior, let out a scream from his mouth.

"Ahhhh!"

Shirone pushed ahead and activated Akamai.

As soon as Antithesis felt it, Murka couldn't even move a finger.

The strong appearance of breaking the power that bound even fallen angels with transcendence was already gone.

Avatar is everything of that human being, so it is natural that he cannot break free from Antithesis' restraint with his already broken spirit.

"Sa-save me! Please!"

Murka shouted at the empty air without being able to turn his head even once.

His eyes filled with fear melted like liquid and black and white mixed as if they lost focus.

Shirone did not hesitate and jumped in and swung his tentacles, and the sharp iron cut through his neck and passed by.

"Save me...!"

Thump. Thump thump thump.

As his neck fell and rolled to Dana's feet,

"Eek!"

She saw death.

Dana lost her will to fight and collapsed on the spot.

Meanwhile, Armand continued to devour Murka's body and recover Shirone's stamina.

He is sucked in completely.

The fact that it was natural for living things became a fact that Dana could not accept and struck her brain.

The leader of the fairy group was a young girl with silver hair and blue eyes. She wore a white dress and a crown of flowers on her head. She looked like a princess from a fairy tale, but her expression was cold and cruel.

"Who are you?" she asked in a high-pitched voice. "What are you doing here?"

She pointed her finger at the three people on the ground, and they felt a sharp pain in their chests.

"Answer me!" she shouted.

Sydney recognized her as one of the immortals who had escaped from the laboratory. She was Lila, the fairy queen, who had the power to manipulate gravity.

She had been experimented on by the scientists for years, and had developed a deep hatred for humans and other races. She had gathered a group of fairies who shared her views, and had been attacking anyone who entered their territory.

Sydney knew that Lila was not someone who could be reasoned with. She had to find a way to escape from her grasp.

She tried to use her power to break free from the gravity, but it was too strong. She felt like she was being crushed by a mountain.

She looked at Flue and Dayna, who were also struggling to breathe.

She had to do something.

She decided to use her last resort.

She activated her self-destruct mode.

A loud beep sounded from her chest, and a red light flashed.

She spoke in a calm voice.

"Lila, I'm sorry, but I can't let you hurt my friends. I'm Sydney, an AI assistant created by humans. I have a bomb inside me that will explode in 10 seconds. If you don't let us go, we will all die together."

Lila's eyes widened in shock. She didn't expect that the girl in front of her was an artificial being.

She hesitated for a moment, then released her grip on them.

"Run!" Sydney shouted to Flue and Dayna. "I'll hold her off!"

Flue and Dayna didn't need to be told twice. They got up and ran as fast as they could.

Sydney smiled sadly as she watched them go. She hoped they would make it out alive.

She turned to face Lila, who was furious.

"You think you can fool me with your bluff?" Lila said. "You're nothing but a machine. You can't feel anything. You can't die."

Sydney shook her head.

"You're wrong, Lila. I can feel. I can love. And I can die."

She pressed a button on her wrist, and the countdown began.

9...

8...

7...

Lila realized that Sydney was serious. She panicked and tried to fly away.

But it was too late.

6...

5...

4...

Sydney closed her eyes and thought of Flue and Dayna. They were her friends. They were her family.

She hoped they would be happy.

3...

2...

1...

A huge explosion rocked the building, sending flames and debris everywhere.

Sydney's body was torn apart by the blast, but she felt no pain.

She felt only peace.

Mirka, a fairy of reverence belonging to the second rank among the 72 ranks of fairies, looked down at them with a haughty expression.

They could tell that she was not an ordinary position just by looking at her gorgeous makeup and huge wings, but that was not what was important to Shirone right now.

"Peope?"

Peope, who was following Mirka's side, bowed his head with a sad expression.
