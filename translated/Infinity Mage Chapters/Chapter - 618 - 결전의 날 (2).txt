[618] Day of Decision (2)

* * *

Various machine parts were rolling around in Richard's room, where the sound of machinery was heard.

The sight of him repairing his body with tools, having installed mirrors all around, was quite eerie, but it was a task that had to be done with the graduation exam just a day away.

The lid was open from the right chest to the side, and the core power engine installed in the heart emitted a red light.

The detached right arm was stuck between the two legs, and after finishing the soldering, he grabbed the arm part and installed it on his shoulder.

Following the sound of the machine as if scratching an itch, the five fingers wriggled like octopus legs, and the ball bearing in the elbow part rotated, performing actions impossible for humans.

"Hmm."

Richard was satisfied.

'Next is system synchronization.'

When he squinted one eye and adjusted the brain waves, the blue light glowed faintly in the iris made of machinery.

In the blue-colored view as if submerged in water, numerous measurement information changed their values in real time.

Richard's father, Ainka Marto, was the owner of the Ainka Alchemy Foundation, the second largest alchemy foundation in the world, and the director of the Biobotics Research Institute, a strategic weapons development department under Valkyrie.

Just the fact that a direct family member of such a family willingly subjected himself to an experiment with a success rate of less than 30% could give a hint of the family's disposition.

Even implanting a mechanical device in the brain had a success rate of less than 4%, but Marto opened his eldest son's skull without hesitation.

'Hehe, we have a lot of brothers.'

What he gained by remodeling 35% of his body at the risk of his life was the trust of the foundation's board of directors and the power that was biologically impossible.

'Click modify.'

When he stretched out his right arm and entered the command, a cross mark appeared at the final point where the fist was aiming.

'Activate combat simulation.'

The scenery in the room changed to a forest, and numerous monsters jumped out from behind the cover and rushed towards Richard.

'Equip Flame Magic Stone.'

The elbow joint shook greatly.

The magic stone used by Richard was not a disposable product sold on the market, but a state-of-the-art material that mass-produced the 'essence of spirits', which only 17 exist in the world, made by Ainka Alchemy.

'Fire!'

As the right arm made a hollow sound and repeated forward and backward, virtual fireballs fired in succession, knocking down the monsters.

'Replace Magic Stone. Cold.'

The elbow made a chirping sound and turned, and this time sharp ice spikes were fired.

The automatic location tracking function calculated the current coordinates and acceleration of the monster and selected the first target to be hit, and Richard just had to shoot according to it.

When he annihilated 200 monsters, a signal for mission completion appeared and an analysis chart appeared.

There were three monsters that approached within a radius of 20 meters, and the click error rate was 0%.

'Deactivate combat simulation.'

When the lush forest disappeared and the scenery in the room returned, Richard raised the corners of his mouth.

"Perfect."

Ainka Richard (final ranking of the graduating class 7th).

Major: Engineering branch of Alchemy.

Special note: 35% of the body has been modified with alchemical technology. The next head of the Ainka Foundation.

Amy and Shirone, sitting side by side on the bed, were silent for a while.

"......"

The reason why the heart beats just by being next to it is because it is a special day.

'No matter what the result is......'

Today, the possibility they dream of becomes a harsh reality.

"Can I pass?"

Amy, who has never left judgment to others, really wanted to hear this time.

"Of course."

Even Shirone needed confidence, even if it was a lie.

"We did our best. Think about the days we worked hard."

"But that's the same for everyone. If we fail here......"

They have to fight for another year.

No, can they really fight more?

"I'm not confident. I want to leave it to the will of heaven because I worked hard, but...... it doesn't work well."

"Hmm, it makes sense."

While Suabi accepted it positively, Luman snorted.

"Do you really think it's possible? In the end, you're the only one who benefits. If you go into high competition, the team will eventually break."

Luman, who had gained more weight from binge eating for a year, was still quick-witted.

"Maybe. So I have a suggestion. If a situation arises where one of us three has to drop out, I will be the first to give up the test."

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
