[584] In the Name of God (3)

* * *

Shirone returned to the dormitory and sat on the bed.

With the winner and loser being decided tomorrow, the burden of reward and cost resurfaced.

'Yes, I have no choice.'

He has to destroy Eden's Absolute Barrier.

'But how?'

He spoke confidently in front of his friends, but the answer was still nowhere to be found.

'I have to find out. Flu senior would have found a way somehow.'

A wizard trained to respond to all variables.

Miro said that was the only pro and the highest title a wizard could get.

'First of all, the laser.'

If there is a way to keep accumulating energy, Eden's shield will eventually have to break.

'But Eden is thinking the same thing I am.'

The problem starts here.

If it's not a scarecrow, the enemies are also trying their best to find the answer.

'He'll avoid it before the energy accumulates. In fact, there's no need to suppress it, right? If he makes it out of bounds?'

There was also a way to push Eden to the end of the field with a high-output mass wave, but the countermeasure was not much different from the laser.

'Eden is too light. That's the key.'

It was a problem that Eden flew away like a feather in the wind, even though he could break a mountain.

'Come to think of it, it was the same in heaven.'

Only after reversing the cause of 127 years with Valhalla Action could he get enough output to annihilate Archangel Pyle.

Shirone's eyes darkened as he remembered the time.

'I fought very inefficiently.'

It was fortunate that he got the result, but it might have seemed like an amateur to the team members.

Anyway, it was also evidence that he had grown a little more that his face was hot at the judgment of the past.

"The solution is this. Somehow make Eden not pushed by the mass wave. Then you can destroy it with Ataraxia."

What about pouring a photon cannon while holding her down with a shining chain?

'The shining chain will break first.'

When his thoughts were blocked, Shirone, who was frustrated, bent his upper body and hit the back of his head on the wall.

He couldn't think of a way to destroy Eden's shield even if he used all the methods he had.

'Should I give up? If it's now, I can strategize again with Erukie...'

Shirone's head turned roughly.

'No. There must be thousands, tens of thousands of ways. I just can't find one of them.'

Coordinate.

He had to find a way to fix Eden in the coordinates even when exposed to the powerful output of Ataraxia.

'There's no way to fix it! No, there is! No, there isn't!'

Shirone was in agony, tearing at the blanket as if his heart was being wrung out like a rag.

'How do things get fixed? No, there are no fixed objects, right? That was the problem from the beginning. The thing about coordinates is...'

Shirone's eyes popped open.

"Ah. Ah."

A small voice leaked from his mouth, looking at the ceiling and imagining something.

"Time and space."

All the answers are hidden in the problem.

"There is no problem."

Even in the middle of the dark night, Eden did not go into the dormitory and prayed in a deep cave.

"As long as you protect me."

On the eve of the last day of the Scramble Royal, her omnipotence was being strengthened to the maximum.

She couldn't lose to Shirone, even to regain the honor of the Yor sect that Gauld had tarnished.

'He'll definitely come up with a different countermeasure. He's a smart kid, after all.'

But Eden also had no intention of enduring with just the name of God.

The reason she was recognized in the Yor sect was because her desperate faith was based on rationality.

It meant that she didn't refuse when someone gave her bread, saying that God would feed me.

'Ataraxia can't destroy the Absolute Barrier. Even if he finds a better way, he'll just avoid it.'

'Isn't there a way to fix it! No, there is! No, there isn't!'

As his mind was wrung out like a rag, Shirone tore at the blanket in frustration.

'There's no such thing as a fixed object, is there? That was the problem from the beginning. The thing about coordinates is...'

Shirone's eyes popped open.

"Ah. Ah."

A small voice leaked from his mouth, looking at the ceiling and imagining something.

"Time and space."

All the answers are hidden in the problem.

"There is no problem."

Even in the middle of the dark night, Eden did not go into the dormitory and prayed in a deep cave.

"As long as you protect me."

On the eve of the last day of the Scramble Royal, her omnipotence was being strengthened to the maximum.

She couldn't lose to Shirone, even to regain the honor of the Yor sect that Gauld had tarnished.

'He'll definitely come up with a different countermeasure. He's a smart kid, after all.'

'Ataraxia can't destroy the Absolute Barrier. Even if he finds a better way, he'll just avoid it.'

"If it was the answer that God had given her from the beginning, it was never a denial of God, even if she avoided the attack.

'Tomorrow, I will become a true daughter of God. And I will erase the name of Gaold from the roster.'

The prayer of Eden echoed in the cave.

'It is impossible to tie things to coordinates.'

Shirone was sitting in the Kabujo before she knew it.

As the sequence formula rushed at a tremendous speed and finally entered the realm of respect, a golden glow began to flicker from his body.

'But I can. I can do it with this!'

As the incarnation of the angel of light scattered into particles and swirled like a whirlwind, all the objects in the room began to twist as if they were wrung out.

* * *

The next morning.

Before returning to school, Fermi visited Radum, the shadow of Bashka.

It's where Canis and Arin grew up, but the darkness of Radum they experienced was just the tip of the iceberg.

Not only the terrorist group called the Black Revolution, which recently blew up the Gold Tower, but also the time bomb of the capital where many Ayn species are hiding in the hardship concealment facility and planning to overthrow the human world.

As such, the eyes of those watching Fermi were also fierce.

"You're an outsider."

As soon as he stepped into a deserted place, he heard a voice.

But where Fermi turned his head, there was only the deep shadow of the building.

"I'm lost. Where is this?"

"You can't come to Radum just because you're lost."

The entrance to Radum is strictly prohibited from entering and exiting, with a large number of troops stationed 24 hours a day.

"Do you know where this is because you know the back door?"

Fermi threw a gold coin into the shadow.

The gold coin that went into the darkness disappeared in an instant.

"Just go. I think I'm going to be late for my appointment."

"…How much do you have?"

Fermi smirked.

"Well? About 10 billion gold?"

There was no word from the shadow, as if slightly taken aback.

"I could give you about 100 million gold."

The shadows flowed down from the buildings around them as if they had been oiled, and surrounded Fermi.

'Is it a black shadow?'

They are invisible in the dark.

"Maybe you really lost your way. Or maybe you're a clumsy human."

He couldn't tell where the voice was coming from.

"Here is Radum. Money can't protect you here."

The shadows all stood up and poured down on Fermi.

"Is that so?"

A particle of light smaller than a speck floated on Fermi's palm.

"What about a 100 million gold magic?"

Time slows down.

"Wha...t..."

During the time it took for the shadow to spit out two syllables, the wave of light expanded at a tremendous speed into the entire Radum.

"Kyaaaak!"

A woman's scream was heard as the darkness lifted.

"I've prepared this and that because it's Radum."

Fermi looked down at the woman holding a pair of swords.

The woman, with gray skin, pointed ears, and deep double eyelids, was biting her lips and crouching down.

"I'm seeing a black shadow for the first time. It looks like this. I heard that the skin is sold very expensively."

"You... how..."

The skin of the black shadow has a transparent effect in the dark.

"Shall we peel it off?"

As madness swirled in Fermi's eyes, the black shadow twitched and twisted her upper body into the darkness.

"If you run away, you die."

"Kuk!"

The black shadow's movement stopped.

They, who have been practicing the law of darkness since birth, but the magic of light cast by Fermi was so powerful that even resistance was impossible.

'What kind of magic is it?'

As expected, Fermi was floating a small particle of light that he had cast a while ago in his hand.

"Isn't it fun? It's called the Big Bang. It's a magic developed by a wizard named Alpheus to suppress the Grand Wizard Arcane."

"Arcane...."

The name of Arcane, the authority of dark magic, was also famous among the black shadows.

"Here is Radum. Money can't protect you here."

The shadows all stood up and poured down on Fermi.

"Is that so?"

A particle of light smaller than a speck floated on Fermi's palm.

"What about a 100 million gold magic?"

Time slows down.

"Wha...t..."

During the time it took for the shadow to spit out two syllables, the wave of light expanded at a tremendous speed into the entire Radum.

The party dismissed it as not such a great magic, but anyway, as a member of the Red Line, it was listed in the statutory magic for posterity.

'Of course, I didn't learn it myself.'

If someone learned magic and bought it with money, that was it.

"What do you want?"

"As rumored, the concealment facility is thorough. Honestly, I lost my way. So..."

Fermi grabbed her wrist, stood her up, and leaned in.

"Ah..."

"Black and white are good at intelligence. Can I ask for directions? I will give you a reward."

Black and white stared at Fermi's face, smiling like a rascal.

'What the hell is this person...?'

He had met many humans, but he was the first non-regulation eater.

* * *

"I will take care of Amy. I will decide today."

Around noon, Kaiden declared to Hershey, taking his cross sword.

It wasn't a bad suggestion if Amy could retire, but it was doubtful whether she would be wrapped up obediently.

"Even if you refuse, I will hit Amy."

Realizing that he couldn't stop Kaiden anyway, Hershey changed the line to help the strategy as much as possible.

"Wait, wait."

When Kaiden turned around, Hershey reached out.

"If you want to hit Amy, there's a condition."

* * *

Iruki and Dorothy teamed up to collect 12 scrambles.

Even if a retire occurred, the number of scrambles summoned was the same as the initial participants, so the remaining number was 72.

"Pisho's collection speed is slower than yesterday."

It meant that he was moving with Hershey.

Dorothy, who expanded the spirit zone with Jona's ability, frowned and said.

"It's coming this way. It's a collision in three minutes."

'Master Card.'

The random card was added to Hershey's status, which was ⓡⓡ, in real time.

'Random three (ⓡⓡⓡ)?'

It is impossible to count at the point where the first scramble of the 7th day is summoned.

Therefore, the probability of black and white coming out when three random cards were opened was still 50 percent.

'I can't read the deck. I have to go up one more step.'

Iruki received a scramble from Hickory, made it into a random card, and then opened it.

His current hand was ●●●○(dictator), and Hershey also added one more hand to match the 4th stage.

'Again random (ⓡⓡⓡⓡ)?'

Iruki and Hershey, who arrived at the place where the scramble was, found each other and hung up at the same time.

'What's the deck?'

Hershey's status was ○●○●(democracy).

'Random four and democracy? Damn it! It's a complete gamble!'

Iruki, who gave up the scramble, took Dorothy and ran back into the forest.

'Unless it's Eden, it's suicidal to make infinity by specifying a deck. The best thing is to mix random.'

Iruki received four scrambles from Hickory, and when he opened four random cards, the monarchy (○○○●) came out.

'I can't make a pope (○○○○) without counting after all.'

Iruki reached out.

"Give me one more."

When he chose a white card, Iruki's hand was upgraded to ○○●○○(emperor).

Of course, Hershey's status would be ⓡⓡⓡⓡ○.

'From now on, it's a probability fight.'

The corners of Iruki's mouth rose slightly.

* * *

At 2 p.m., the second scramble was summoned, but Shiro-ne, who had been sitting in the forest since morning, did not move.

Anyway, the point at which he confronts Eden is the last stage of the Scramble Royal, but there was also the fact that he could not feel the flow of time.

'16th round.'

It was the location where Shiro-ne's sequence formula was currently running.

'I have to pull it up as much as possible.'

If you don't destroy the limit in advance, you won't be able to respond immediately to changes in the game with Eden.

At some point, the time machine twisted grotesquely, refracting the scenery around it so that it could not even recognize its shape.

A silent twist.

...!

...!

All the bugs within a radius of 5 meters that have lost the direction of time were screaming pheromones of scream.
