[259] The Revealed Truth (4)

But Shirone shook her head.

There was less than a month left until the end of the semester.

The practical exam was over, and all that was left was the theory exam.

From next semester, she would enter the graduating class, so she had to think that this was the only time to reinforce her basics.

That was the rational judgment, but her emotions did not move as she thought.

Shirone, who was not shaken by anything, could not see the books in front of her parents.

That was also why she came to the research club as soon as the class was over and fell into endless distractions.

Nade opened the door of the research club and came in.

"Hey, Shirone, we're here."

Iruki put a bag of bread on the table and sat down on the sofa opposite Shirone.

"I bought some food. You must be hungry. Eat if you have anything in mind."

"Yeah, thanks."

"I met Dante at the cafeteria."

"Yeah? How is he?"

"What do you mean? He's very eager. He seems to be staying at school. He said he would definitely beat you and graduate first in the graduation exam. He told me to tell you directly. He's going to declare war soon, so think of a line to hit him back in advance."

Shirone laughed in spite of her troubles.

It was indeed Iruki, who was meticulous. As soon as Dante and his party rose to rivals, he seemed to be ready for battle.

"Yeah, I'll think about it. I'm laughing because of you."

At the words that he was laughing because of him, Iruki smiled bitterly. He was obviously not feeling well even if he didn't show it.

Nade, who was wondering if there was any way to make Shirone feel a little more comfortable, remembered one rumor and said.

"I heard this today at noon, but Principal Olivia seems to have called Klein. Maybe she'll come up with some measures for you. Don't worry too much."

"Yeah......"

Shirone had also heard the rumor that Olivia might stay at school.

But it was uncertain how much help she could give after the incident had already happened.

The most frustrating thing was that she couldn't do anything.

Rumors are intangible, so you can't fight them or handcuff them and lock them up in prison.

All Shirone could do was hope that this wind would pass by without causing any incidents.

Klein, who received the call, arrived in Creas by carriage that night.

Olivia was also in charge of the inspectorate, which was the highest executive in the faculty, so she would be in trouble if she handled it clumsily.

Klein grabbed only the basic clothes and caught any inn to sleep and headed to Alpheus Magic School from morning.

The students who recognized her murmured.

It was clear that the article that interviewed Shirone's parents caused a stir. And no matter what feelings they had for Shirone, there would be no students who liked her.

Klein thought today's schedule would not be easy.

'It doesn't matter. It's already done anyway.'

By revealing Shirone's origin, Dante's star power is maintained.

He fed other correspondents who were looking for a new star, and he was able to continue his rice line as it was.

Olivia would also want Dante to succeed.

She wouldn't stand by and watch provocative articles as much as she had social status, but it was something she would finish with a few words of scolding.

Klein straightened her clothes and stood in front of the principal's office. She cleared her throat with a cough and reported in a cheerful voice with manners.

"It's Klein."

"Come in."

Olivia's voice was what she envied most as a correspondent.

If God allowed it, she would choose her voice over the second-class grand mage position.

But today it felt bad.

Her voice had a special power to pierce human hearts with authority in spirit magic.

It wasn't a good feeling when I heard it.

As she entered the principal's office, Olivia sat with a cold expression. Next to her was Alpheus' former principal, who was unusually seated, and opposite him was Shirone.

"Hello, Olivia, Alpheus. Oh, and hello to you too, Shirone."

Klein greeted the three of them warmly, making eye contact with each one.

No one answered. Especially Olivia, who didn't even tell her to sit down.

"Can you explain this article?"

Olivia threw a magazine at Klein's feet.

It was not a pleasant feeling to see her own article fall to the floor.

But Klein didn't show it. The atmosphere was much worse than she expected.

"It's the duty and mission of a correspondent to deliver the facts. Is there a problem?"

Shirone's brow furrowed.

Correspondents have a duty to deliver the facts, but they are not the only ones who have the right to pursue precious values in this world.

Even if a clear line cannot be drawn, there is a responsibility to uphold if there is a duty to fulfill one's mission.

Klein held her head high as if she had nothing to back away from and met the eyes of the three.

How many times had she faced this kind of pressure while covering aspiring magicians?

Noble elites would lobby her to write good articles, and sometimes unknown thugs would raid and mess up her house.

She overcame all those hardships and made it to this position.

And Olivia knew her situation better than anyone.

She had no reason to treat her badly, as much as she had overcome the threats of countless competitors to make Dante a star.

"Of course, I expected that Shirone's interview would cause social repercussions. But Olivia, it can't be helped. I just wrote down what I interviewed. It's not my fault that Shirone's background is different from others."

Olivia smiled faintly.

Was it over? Klein sincerely thought so.

But her smile disappeared in an instant.

"You've grown a lot, Klein."

Klein's face hardened.

"You were a kid who couldn't even talk to me when you first joined the Teachers' Association. Now you're trying to go beyond being equal and play with words...."

Klein sensed that the situation was going wrong, but she was also fighting for her livelihood.

She'd rather die here than have her 10-year career go down the drain.

"Huhu, did I? It's been too long, I don't remember well. Come to think of it, you've aged as well, Olivia. You used to be unimaginable with such uncultured speech. The faction must be scary."

Olivia and Klein's eyes collided.

Alpheus couldn't stand it and opened his mouth.

"Klein, no matter how important the article is, there is a responsibility in recording one's life...."

"Shut up."

Olivia cut him off.

What a frustrating old man. Klein was such a stubborn child that he couldn't be persuaded by such moral arguments.

Using informal speech in an official setting was also a ploy to pressure Klein.

Alpheus closed his mouth in embarrassment, but the effect was great.

Klein still maintained a smile, but her face was pale as paper.

"Are you crazy, Klein?"

Klein couldn't breathe. On the contrary, her heart was madly pumping oxygen throughout her body.

If Olivia really wanted to step on her, she wouldn't stand a chance. Even a child knew that.

She didn't know why she was so hostile to her.

This was also for Dante's sake, and she had always tacitly agreed with her in such situations.

"I'm sorry if I was rude. But Olivia, this can't be helped. No matter how much you're in charge of auditing the Teachers' Association, you can't put pressure on the article. If this fact is revealed, it won't be me who will be in trouble."

Klein's words had some reason to them.

No one in the Teachers' Association had the authority to edit what a correspondent of the editorial department had legally written.

There was only one exception: when the royal family declared martial law or when illegal corruption was exposed in the process of writing an article.

"No, Kline. You're the one who's ruining your life as a correspondent. How did you get the interview with Sirone's parents? According to Sirone, his parents would never talk about such matters so carelessly."

Kline shrank slightly.

To be honest, he didn't expect Olivia to pursue him so persistently, so he was somewhat relieved about that.

Of course, he didn't threaten or create a coercive atmosphere. He just took advantage of the parents' concern for their child.

"I just... kept asking and they told me. They must have been nervous when I said it was an interview. There are many people like that."

Olivia smiled incredulously.

"Kline, do you think I don't know you?"

Kline clenched his lips and glared at Olivia sadly.

Olivia knew his reporting style inside and out. They had worked together to make Dante a star for 10 years.

That's why he felt more wronged. He deserved a reward for his contribution, but instead he was pressured and felt like crying.

"You probably emphasized one thing to the commoners who are blind to the magic society. The Teachers' Association. You used Sirone's student status to sell the authority of the Teachers' Association, right? From the parents' perspective, they had no choice but to agree. They must have thought that a student who was marked by the Teachers' Association was doomed."

Sirone's eyes hardened.

If he really pressured his parents like that, he would never forgive him.

Kline felt like a rat trapped in a dead end alley. Olivia was determined to catch him today.

But he still had one more weapon left.

It was self-destruction.

He took off his mask of hypocrisy and shed tears with a sorrowful expression.

"Yes, I did that. But why? You know that too, Olivia. Everyone does that. If you don't let me do that much, I can't even write an article."

Kline's words contained an implicit threat. It was a question of whether Dante had not done the same.

But Olivia didn't flinch at all.

Of course, if she dug deeper, she would have some flaws too.

But it was a delusion to think that Olivia, a Red Line second-class grand mage and an auditor of the Teachers' Association, was in the same position as Kline.

"Kline, I'm not blaming you as a correspondent. I'm trying to punish you for betraying me, who trusted you for a long time."

Kline felt his spirit crumble.

It was a challenge. Let's see who survives when we bite each other. It was a threat.

If he were like Alpheus, he wouldn't have anything to fear.

But Olivia was savvy about the world and had a somewhat materialistic nature.

If such a person had a genius mind, Kline never had a chance to compete with her from the start.

"What did I betray? To be honest with you, I thought you would like it. Dante lost. I just wanted your disciple to succeed."

Olivia finally relaxed her expression.

She had stripped off Kline's hypocrisy without leaving a trace, so now she could have a real conversation.

"Thank you for thinking of me, but that's overstepping your bounds. And it wasn't for me, it was for you. If Dante is gone, your position in the Teachers' Association will also be shaken. But not me. Dante lost, but Sirone won. Sirone is also my disciple, so I have nothing to lose."

"What? What do you mean?"

Kline looked dumbfounded.

How could Sirone be her disciple?

He looked at Alpheus, but he also seemed clueless and had a blank expression.

"Sirone is your disciple? But Olivia, you're a temp worker. I heard you're quitting your principal job soon."

"I was going to do that, but I changed my mind. I'm staying at Alpheus Magic School. I'll be appointed as vice principal next semester. So you're a traitor who tried to ruin the future of my student."

Kline still couldn't understand her words and rolled his eyes in confusion.
