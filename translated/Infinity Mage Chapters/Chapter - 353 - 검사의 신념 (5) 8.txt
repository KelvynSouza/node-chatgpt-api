[353] The Prosecutor's Belief (5)

Everyone's eyes turned to the sky. The black sword blocked the sun and rotated, then plunged into the ground behind Rai with a thud.

Rai didn't look back. His eyes were fixed on Lian.

Lian, who was frozen in a stance with his sword aimed, couldn't move a finger. He was in terrible pain from the aftermath of the Divine Transcendence.

In the long silence, Rai clicked his tongue and turned around.

"You lost. Let's stop."

Lian's pupils shook with shock. It was the first time he heard Rai's declaration of defeat in 18 years.

But Rai didn't show much emotion and pulled out the black sword and put it in his scabbard. Then he walked over to Klump and bowed his head.

"I lost. I admit defeat."

"Kuku, you got caught up in his pace. But you were fiery and not like yourself, so I liked it."

Rai muttered with a bitter smile on his lips.

"That's why you shouldn't hang out with idiots."

"But it wasn't bad, was it? You feel refreshed, right?"

Rai thought for a moment and whispered past Klump.

"...I think I've become a little more like a prosecutor."

Reina followed Rai with quick steps.

"Wait, come here. Is your hand okay? You have to go on dispatch tomorrow, right?"

"It's nothing. I just dropped the sword because of a cramp."

"Don't try to fool me! Do prosecutors get cramps that easily? Give me your hand."

Reina grabbed Rai's wrist and twisted it. She could tell by looking at the calluses that were no different from skin that he didn't come to this position just by talent.

"As expected. I knew this would happen."

Reina frowned as she examined his back of his hand.

The left hand is used to cushion the shock when holding the sword. But the nails of his index, middle, and ring fingers were all gone.

"Don't make a fuss. Nails are easy to fall off."

"That's the first time I've heard that! Geez, you can't even cut steak like this. Come here. Let me put some pressure on it."

Reina took out a bandage from the first aid kit prepared in the training hall. And she wrapped Rai's index, middle, and ring fingers tightly.

As the tension eased, even the people who watched felt tired. But only Kuan was still looking at Lian with a serious expression.

'Divine Transcendence....'

Lian's swordsmanship in real combat was definitely amazing. It was also a performance that could never be shown in a swordsmanship school that evaluates by stages.

'But I would have avoided it.'

Divine Transcendence is dangerous. It wasn't just that the power increased.

The movement that bit Rai at the end was so bizarre that it was hard to create even with gravity manipulation. But Rai still responded to Lian's strong sword with a strong sword.

Pride? Or lack of experience? If not, was there some other variable that he couldn't read that remained on the battlefield?

"A prosecutor is a technician who handles swords."

"General."

Klump was standing behind him before he knew it.

"But a sword is ultimately a tool for killing. That's an undeniable truth. But why do we pursue swords?"

Kuan couldn't answer.

"A single sword can never change the world. But the sword in your heart is different. A skilled prosecutor wins in war, but a knight with conviction changes the world. Rai burned with Lian's conviction."

"The sword in my heart...."

"Maybe Divine Transcendence is the embodiment of conviction."

Kuan recalled something from a long time ago.

His own appearance before Achilles' gun fell out. He was so firm in his mind that he even refused Pungjang's offer and chose to die.

"I had one too."

Klump looked at Kuan with a kind eye. He was a pitiful junior as a soldier and as a prosecutor.

"How long will you wander? Come back to the army. My direct subordinate officer retired this time. It would be a great help if you could take over."

"I'll think about it. Thank you for your concern."

Kuan was sincere, but he had no intention of returning to the army.

He realized it clearly from today's confrontation. He was a broken sword. He could never reach transcendence without embracing a new sword.

"Grandpa, can I retire now?"

Lian approached with big strides. His face was covered with cold sweat from enduring the pain. Since he proved himself with results, not words, Klump had no excuse to stop him.

"Yes, you won. Whether you retire or become a knight, do whatever you want."

"That's what I said from the beginning, right? You just wasted your time fighting."

Rai, who had bandages on his fingers, changed his clothes and said.

"Don't go and become a corpse somewhere. I feel like I have to look for you if you die."

Contrary to everyone's expectations, Lian did not get angry. They had fought their best, so he had no intention of looking back at the duel with resentment.

But there was one question that still remained.

"Hey, let me ask you one thing."

Rai stopped buttoning his shirt and turned around.

"The technique that blew up the ground, that's an application of sword energy, right?"

"So what?"

"Why didn't you use sword energy on me? You could have broken my sword and ended the duel."

Rai tilted his head with a puzzled expression. There was a limit to teasing, was he trying to mock him now?

But he couldn't feel any provocation from Lian's expression.

'Don't tell me this kid is serious?'

Rai looked at Klump.

"What's going on? You didn't tell Lian?"

"Hehe, what can I do? He took it away like a thief cat. He didn't even properly choose a successor. He said he opened the schema, but that was also a lie."

Rai snorted at his natural lie.

"You didn't plan to give it to me anyway, did you?"

"Hey, you don't need it either."

"Tsk!"

Lian interrupted the conversation that only they knew about.

"What are you talking about? Just answer me. Why didn't you try sword energy?"

Rai turned his body with annoyance and headed for the exit of the training hall.

"Don't ask me, ask grandpa. This is really a mess. A swordsman who doesn't even know what he's fighting with."

Reina followed Rai.

"Are you really leaving today?"

"No, I'm going to sleep. I'm tired. Bring my meal to my room."

Lian glared at Rai's indifference and stomped his feet.

"Hey! Where are you going? Why didn't you use sword energy? Don't make me uneasy and just tell me!"

'There's no cure for stupidity.'

Ignoring Lian's shouts from behind him, Rai immersed himself in his thoughts.

The Ogent family had two lines of black hair and blue hair at the same time.

Why didn't grandpa give him a great sword?

When he was young, he thought it was because they were both blue-haired. But now he felt like he knew vaguely through today's duel.

At least the owner of that sword was Lian.

Shirone and Tess decided to stay at Reina's mansion for a day.

The three of them gathered in Lian's room and relieved their frustration for half a year. The most talked about issue was Amy's graduation exam failure.

"By the way, how is Amy? She must have been heartbroken."

They had seen Amy's disqualification news in the Spirit academic journal. The article was shocking that the genius of the Carmis family had failed in the early stage of the graduation exam.

"Yeah. She was depressed for a while, but she's fine now. There will be a different result in next year's exam."

"Yeah. Amy can overcome it. I miss her. It was so fun back then."

Lian recalled the days in heaven. Fighting with Imir and realizing transcendence was an important turning point in his life.

"Amy deserves to be a mage. Tell her I'm rooting for her. I'll go and cheer her up in person at the next graduation exam."

I hope this helps you understand Korean better. Do you have any other questions or requests?

A year later, Shirone had to take the graduation exam, so Lian couldn't miss that place.

"I wish I could go. I can't. The swordsmanship school ends later than the magic school. I'd rather drop out and practice with Lian."

Lian waved his hand and said.

"What are you talking about? You're a student who competes for the top rank in the swordsmanship school. You should graduate with honors."

"But I feel so empty without you. I really want to follow you."

As Tess made a face as if he was about to cry, Lian hurriedly looked for something to change the subject. Then he found a sword that Shirone had placed next to his desk and asked.

"By the way, Shirone, do you carry a sword around?"

"Oh, that's a gift."

Shirone told them what had happened in Kazra. It was easy for Lian and Tess to understand the object because they had experienced heaven.

As they encouraged him with interest, Shirone demonstrated himself.

First, he performed magic with rated control, then activated diamond armor. The sword swallowed Shirone and in an instant a robe made of organic material wrapped around him.

Lian couldn't close his mouth at the sight of the eerie but powerful presence. Tess pointed to the ball floating in the air and asked.

"But what is this bead?"

"That's a magic calculation device. It does a technique called time division for me, so the calculation is much faster. And this crystal ball on the gauntlet is a magic amplification device. Using these two things, you can expand the range of magic operation."

"I see. That's amazing. There are objects with such complex functions."

Armand was a weapon that any swordsman would envy. But his friends didn't show more than interest. For those who had embraced the sword of faith, any device was nothing more than a tool.

'I wish Lian could handle Armand.'

The knight's performance was different from the swordsmanship school's class.

The world does not provide Lian with a systematic difficulty level. He could easily get rid of third-rate thugs or robbers, but among the criminals, those who stood out had skills that even the kingdom would have trouble with.

In that respect, Armand, who enhanced the user's physical functions and had its own defense power, would surely help.

But unlike Dante's case, the magic sword did not respond to Lian.

Armand provides the optimal combat environment for all users, but high-level tactical understanding and complex system control skills are essential to get 100% efficiency.

It was difficult for Lian, who was straightforward and aggressive, to handle Armand's functions perfectly, and Armand seemed to know that as well.

'No matter how much it's a sword, it's really like a knife.'

But Lian had no intention of relying on anything. His confidence was sky-high after his confrontation with Rai.

"You don't have to worry! I'm just starting from now on! I'm going to achieve an undefeated record from today!"

Shirone smiled warmly as he watched Lian beat his chest confidently.

He was fire. Someday he would become a huge fire that would burn the world and come back to him.

That night.

Lian was buried in his blanket, curled up and moaning in pain.

The aftermath of transcendence did not end in one go. Rather, the most severe pain came at night when his body recovered its function.

"Ugh! Ugh!"

A moan escaped from his throat, but he bit his pillow and endured it

But it was not a wall that could never be crossed.

'It narrowed. It definitely narrowed.'

He could not expect the same result if he faced him again, but there was a certain section where he had clearly surpassed him. He was sure of that.

'I can do it. I didn't choose the wrong path.'

Lian felt a thrill just from the fact that it was not an unreachable distance. Even as his body trembled from the pain, laughter leaked from his throat.

"Hehe, hehehehe."

The night of pain and pleasure was passing by.
