[308] The Master of Fire (6)

"If you ignore my words one more time, I'll blow everything up."

Bosun realized that the situation was much more serious than he expected. He had to be out of his mind to use magic against his own parents.

Orkamp quietly sat next to Eliza. It was a disgrace to show this to the nobles, but he had to stop Kazra's destruction at any cost.

'Damn it. How could this happen to the country I built?'

As everyone bowed their knees, including Orkamp, Bosun became the representative and asked Shirone.

"Now tell me. What do you want to hear? If you have anything you want, I'll do anything."

"Who ordered the assassination of our parents?"

The nobles glanced at each other and fixed their eyes on one person.

Without looking back, Bosun knew who they were looking at and raised his hand.

"I ordered it. If you want revenge, go ahead. But... how about ending it with me?"

"Cut the crap. Do you think I'll forgive you?"

"You can't forgive me, I guess. But how about thinking rationally? No one died anyway. Even if you kill us, can you fight against Her Majesty Tereze? And don't you have your loved ones here?"

Bosun immediately dug into Shirone's weakness.

The fact that he was holding a bomb and trying to reveal the mastermind behind the assassination meant that they still had value as hostages.

Thinking that this might be his last chance, Bosun raised his hands as if he had no intention of approaching.

"I'll follow your will. Everyone involved in this assassination plot will be held legally responsible. You can take your family home. I, Aymar Bosun, a public 4th class mage, guarantee it here. How about solving it by dialogue?"

Shirone's expression softened a bit.

He felt like killing everyone here wouldn't satisfy him, but if he blew up the palace, his family and friends would disappear from the world.

"Charge! Charge!"

A noisy sound came from outside the grand hall. The garrison troops who received the contact came armed.

But as soon as they arrived at the scene, their faces changed to disbelief.

"What, what is this?"

It was a sight beyond imagination. The grand hall, the heart of the palace, was horribly broken.

What shocked them more was that everyone, including Orkamp, was kneeling.

'Now is the time!'

The moment Shirone's eyes moved toward the soldiers, Bosun cast teleportation.

When he approached Shirone, he had already pulled out a dagger from his sleeve.

'Last chance! I have to stab his heart!'

Shirone was shocked to see Bosun rushing in. But Bosun seemed to have made up his mind and stabbed him without hesitation.

The dagger pierced through the flesh with a thud.

Bosun frowned.

He thought Shirone would be groggy, but his reaction was more agile than expected. He twisted his body with all his strength and the blade stuck in his side instead of his heart.

"Damn it."

Shirone couldn't analyze his emotions right now.

He lost his reason and became a beast. The foreign object that came into his body was not only painful but also humiliating.

As soon as he saw Shirone's eyes, Bosun cast earth skin.

His skin quickly covered with dirt. The durability of earth skin cast by a public 4th class plant mage was rock-hard.

The photon cannon hit the earth skin. Thousands of cracks appeared on the mud wall and it shattered.

Bosun's face, filled with horror, was revealed. He spat blood from his mouth as if the shock had penetrated him.

"Aaaaaah!"

Shirone clutched his stomach and writhed in pain.

Above his head, the photon cannon was growing at an incredible speed. People who saw the photon that reached one meter in diameter turned pale.

When I was young, I saw Olina's fierce eyes a few times. But today, she had a kinder smile than anyone else.

That's why Siroone's heart hurt more. For no reason.

"Siroone, do you know how pretty you were when you were a baby? Your smile was so cute like a girl. Every time you did that, your dad made a stupid expression. Then you laughed louder."

Olina told him stories from the past.

"You were such a gentle child. Even if you were angry, you couldn't express it well and couldn't hurt others, so when your friends got angry, you couldn't say anything and came home and moaned."

Olina's eyes became distant. Yes, there was such a time.

But time has passed so quickly. The newborn baby who came as a blessing had grown into a mature boy.

"But mom didn't worry. Being able to understand other people's feelings is very noble. You don't know how happy mom is that you grew up well."

Olina stroked Siroone's cheeks with both hands. Her handsome son looked so hard today.

"You are so tender and kind that you don't even know how to get angry. Even if you are too angry, you can't hurt others, so you can only tell them by abusing yourself."

Olina gently hugged Siroone.

"Seeing how badly you are hurt, it seems that our son was really angry today."

Siroone's eyes swelled. Tears of blood that had flowed until now flowed down with clear tears.

His pupils hurt terribly. It felt like the poison that had risen to his chin was leaking out through a hole. His chest was so full that he could hardly breathe. All his emotions rushed to his eyes and squeezed out.

"Mommy......"

It was the voice of a lost child calling for his mother in a strange place.

Olina, who burst into tears, hugged Siroone's face and stroked his back.

"Yes, my son. Let's go home with mom. Mom will take you home. Don't worry about anything and let's go."

"Mom... Mom..."

Siroone said breathlessly with sorrow.

"They tried to kill mom. Those people... mom..."

"It's okay, Siroone. You protected me, didn't you? Mom is not afraid at all. I'm not afraid of dying for you."

Olina smiled beautifully as she held Siroone's arms, who sobbed like a child.

"Siroone, children are the parents' future. That's why mom can do anything for you."

The huge anger that had dominated Siroone until now began to sink rapidly to the bottom like a collapsing building. The energy of hatred went down endlessly from 10th level, 9th level, 8th level.

The seal boundary of the deep layer 1 was restored.

Siroone's avatar rose in bright light on the statue of the archangel. Behemoth came out of there and returned to the seal boundary. As the pillar of light disappeared, Geppin's security system was released.

Siroone returned to his pure self.

His physical body in reality faced a severe aftermath. He lost consciousness before he felt any pain. As his eyes closed, Spirit Zone disappeared and Ataraxia disappeared.

Olina sat down with her son who collapsed.

She could die for her child, but she couldn't save him. She looked at the enemies who had tried to kill her son and said.

"Please save our son. Please."

No one who belonged to Kazrae stepped forward. But Amy and Reyna moved quickly.

First, they checked that Siroone was breathing. He might be brain dead, but the biggest problem was bleeding. If he didn't get a blood transfusion right away, he wouldn't last an hour.

"Amy, I'll take Siroone with me. You go ahead with the performers and help prepare for surgery. We need to start with blood transfusion, so please accompany your mother and tell the doctor your blood type."
