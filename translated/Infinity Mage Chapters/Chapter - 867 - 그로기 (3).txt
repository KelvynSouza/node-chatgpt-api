Marine looked back at Betelus and looked at Sirone again with a shocked face.

She also had a short time to eat on the battlefield, so she knew many mythical events.

'If that boy is Yahweh...

And among those myths, there was a story of a swordsman who cut off the demons and ended Kashan.

'The Knight of Maha.'

The demons had approached to the ground, but instead of being tense, Ryan, who was looking at the weather, came into his eyes.

'Why are these guys here?'

Wasn't it an unmistakable appearance of a defeated soldier?

If it were normal for her, whether it was a holy war or an army of another country, it was normal to be lifted and taken away.

Thirty demons gathered in a circle and Sirone pointed out one.

"Come over here."

"Me, me?"

He looked around in denial of reality, but none of the demons met his eyes.

The reason why oxidation is scary is that the particles of light destroy the information of the demons at the source.

The surviving demons had already realized that fact, and Sirone in front of them looked like Buddha.

"I have something to ask."

The demon approached and squatted down where Sirone pointed his finger down.

"How can I summon hell?"

"Hell?"

The demons were residents of the back world, but only a handful of them had even heard of hell.

Sirone stared at him and he shrugged his shoulders with a thump.

"I really don't know! I've never heard of it!"

I thought so.

"There's nothing to be afraid of. I'm not Yahweh or Buddha. I'm just an ordinary human."

There was something strange in the demon's eyes.

'He's not Yahweh or Buddha?'

If it was true, the demons no longer had to fear Sirone.

"Re, really?"

"Yeah."

The demon who looked back at his colleague shrugged his shoulders and reached out his finger to Sirone.

"Are you not angry?"

He cautiously poked Sirone's cheek like an explosive, but the light rain did not fall.

"Yeah. I told you, I'm just an ordinary human."

With a shocked look on his face, he smiled strangely with his mouth torn as he was lost in thought.

"Kkkk, that's right!"

The murderous intent that rose from the demon harmonized with the murderous intent of the colleagues standing behind him and rose like a flame.

"Kuk!"

Betelus and Marine hastily took a defensive stance, but it was too much to stop them when they moved into action.

"What are you doing?"

Marine shouted at Ryan who was still watching.

"You have to stop it!"

Even if he wasn't at Yahweh's level, he wasn't Sirone who could handle 30 demons.

But there was a deeper meaning to why Ryan didn't move.

"Guys! It's an opportunity!"

The demons with sharp teeth exposed made a thumping sound and gathered around Sirone.

"Despicable Yahweh, no, human! From now on I'll peel off your flesh

Give me!"

At the moment when the demon who was called by Sirone stood up arrogantly and raised his nails, Sirone said.

"And now."

Light radiated from Sirone's body and rose like a mirage.

"He became Yahweh again."

It was Yahweh's light.

The demons were stunned as they looked at the light mirage that rose up to 10 meters high.

"Bad guy."

Sirone, who was cursed by the demon, smiled as Ryan chuckled.

'Losing is not losing.' It's just a certain form of mind that can be reached at any time by turning your mind upside down.

Of course, turning your mind upside down is the hardest thing for someone, but magicians are experts in dealing with their minds.

"Come over here."

When Sirone wrapped in light gestured, the demon's legs trembled.

But he couldn't refuse, and the demon who had raised his nails obediently sat down.

Sirone reached out to his red and fierce face and the demon closed his eyes tightly.

"I'm sorry."

At first, he doubted his ears.

When he opened his eyes at the gentle touch of his cheek, Shirone's eyes were filled with sadness.

"I didn't try to understand with my heart. I judged by the result without looking for the cause."

As if Betelus had judged Shirone.

"The reason you were born is in humans. You must have been wronged because you were born from evil in the first place."

The demon shook his body.

"What are you doing now? Saying that only makes me itch."

"Repent. Save the world with me."

The demon bowed his head.

"......Thank you for saying that, but."

A murderous aura that was incomparable to Yeta emanated from the demon's body as he slowly stood up.

"We can't do that. Just as we can't live without eating, this is natural for demons."

Shirone's eyelids drooped halfway.

"This is your last chance."

"O Lord, destroy us. If you can suffer by doing so, the demons rushed at him at the same time.

"The greatest pleasure for us!"

As thirty demons pounced on Shirone, a bright explosion of light blinded him.

The curtain of light that hit hundreds of times per second hit his eardrums, and the demons disappeared without a trace.

"Oh my......

Marin couldn't even figure out what had happened, and Betelus was no different.

"Is this, magic?"

No magician on the battlefield could turn demons into dust in such a short time.

Shirone, who had been staring at the survivors, was lost in thought.

'My pain is the pleasure of demons.'

He had reached the stage of understanding them, but true compassion still seemed far away.

"Let's go, Lian."

Shirone kicked his seat and got up, and Lian followed him silently.

"Please wait a moment!"

Betelus approached and knelt down.

"Please take me with you! I beg you!"

Marin joined in with a shrill voice.

"Me, me too! I beg you to follow the great swordsman."

Shirone didn't want to take them.

It seemed that no one could accept him until he apologized to the Ogent family.

Lian said.

"What about the remaining survivors if you follow us? Aren't you responsible for them?"

"That, that's..."

"Forget what happened today. It has nothing to do with what you did. We go our own way."

Betelus bit his lip.

'Damn it! Such an opportunity... Lian said it didn't matter, but Betelus regretted ignoring Shirone so much.

'I should have noticed from the beginning. If I had done well, he would have taken me for sure...

Lian turned to Shirone.

"It's raining, are you okay? Shall I ask for a horse instead?"

"No. It's enough now."

Shirone threw ã€ˆLawbreakerã€‰ lightly and activated Material's ability, and metal began to stick to it.

The thing that landed with a thud was a huge four-legged monster.

"Let's ride Salsoo."

Lian nodded and climbed on Salsoo, and Shirone followed slowly.

The survivors who were surprised by Salsoo looked sharply at Shirone's back of his head.

He stopped and looked up.

"Lian."

Lian knew what he wanted to say.

"Do whatever you want."

He was already burdened with the responsibility of killing Gai, and Shirone didn't want to take responsibility for anything for a while.

'But...

He couldn't do anything wrong.

"Everyone follow me. I'll take you until a city comes out nearby."

The survivors looked bewildered.

"You're taking us with you?"

Shirone was not the type to regret what he had decided, and smiled.

"Yes. It's dangerous here. Let's go to a safe place."

Shirone told Betelus.

"Pack only the necessary supplies and food. We'll leave in 10 minutes."

"Why..."

Betelus was puzzled.

"Why do you care about us? You didn't even recognize the great mage and rather looked down on him."

"You're not really asking because you don't know, are you?"

Shirone tapped the body of Salso with her hand.

"This is the right thing to do."

She didn't bother to explain trivial things, because anyone who was human would know.

"But no one lives like that."

Maybe that was true too.

"Yes."

As she enhanced the ability of Material, Salso's body began to expand to a huge size.

Shirone looked back at Betelus with a sad smile.

"That's why it's so hard." The realm of Yahweh.

He wouldn't understand even 1/100th of it, but he seemed to know what Shirone was carrying.

"I'll prepare as quickly as possible."

Betelus went to get some food and Marin hurriedly got up and directed the survivors.

'Shirone.'

Lian looked down at Shirone with affectionate eyes.

'You say I'm great, but I don't have the confidence to live like you.'

That's why he became Shirone's sword.

'It's really strange. Everyone doubts you even though you're doing the right thing.'

Shirone wasn't wrong.

"Hurry. Hurry up."

The 100 survivors who finished preparing to leave in a hurry boarded Salso.

A normal monster would have broken its leg bones, but Salso, made of metal, didn't budge.

When he moved his steps with a thud, even Betelus, a mage, turned pale.

"It might make you sick because it's so big. But I'll speed up."

As <Law> accelerated Salso, his legs began to move at a speed like riding a horse.

"Uaaaaaa!"

The screams of the people echoed in the desolate city.

An emergency was declared at the command center of the temple.

"Report! A 3 million-strong army of demons is advancing from the southeast of Kettler Mountains!"

"Report! The Altaras region has been occupied. The damage is estimated at 400,000 people!"

Iruki's face darkened at the bad news pouring in from all sides of the army.

"Damn it."

He had already heard through urgent intelligence that the Gustav Empire had disappeared from the map.

'They wiped them out too cleanly.'

Shirone probably didn't intend it, but it was a complete annihilation that didn't even need to turn her head to the base.

It would have been a way to absorb the remaining demons and wait for the time, but Habitz's military Balkan did not give him time.

"Report! The port city of Toasta has been taken. The damage is estimated at 1 million people."

When he heard that, Iruki slammed down on the table.

"Uaaaaaa! Uaaaaaa!"

400,000 or 1 million, it was enough to say one word when spit out by mouth.

"You son of a bitch!"

If he were to recite the lives that resembled those numbers, it would take a lifetime for one person and still not enough.

"What do we do? There's no way to stop them."

Iruki checked the whole map.

The place where the hellish army that was pushing from all sides gathered was Torumia, and there wasn't much time left either.

"There is...

There is a way.

But if Iruki commercialized this technology, humans would not be safe either.

'Pandora's Box.'

Another report came in. 200,000 died.

'I'm sorry, Shirone.'

At the last point of humanity, Iruki suddenly remembered his days at Alpheas Magic School.

"I'll go to Torumia."

The commanders looked at Iruki.

"Now? And are you going to say it yourself?"

"If we delay, we'll miss the only chance. I'll be back soon. Please form a team for me."

Iruki turned back as he headed for the door.

"Oh, and call Nade. Tell him I'll tell him why when I see him."
