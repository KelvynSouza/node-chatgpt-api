[206] 3. The Eternal Ra (3)

Shirone closed her eyes and received the memories that Peope transmitted. It was a warm feeling.

"Thank you, Peope."

If it weren't for Peope, she wouldn't have been able to come this far. If she could rescue Amy and her companions safely, Shirone would gladly give all the credit to Peope.

"Hmph! What am I? I'm just following you because your actions are so curious. I don't care about you at all from now on, so don't get me wrong."

Peope refused to admit it until the end, but Shirone knew. She had a tender and pure heart. That's why she couldn't ignore the pain of humans even though she enjoyed a long life.

"Peope, you'll surely become a great fairy."

"Enough. Hurry up and go in. I'm tired and I don't want to stay here any longer."

Peope stepped aside in the direction of the door opening. She was curious about the inside, but she didn't dare to peek into the angel's room.

As Shirone entered the room, the iron door closed with a thud.

She had only put one door between them, but Peope felt like Shirone had disappeared from the world.

She realized that there was no one left around her and felt a surge of loneliness. Was the top of the world such a lonely place?

"Tsk. I'm going back, whatever."

Peope, who had sorted out her troubled mind, took the elevator of light and arrived at the first floor.

When she arrived at Shama'in, she had to report to Igirin. She had to protect her until the end of the impostor's payment. And then she would sleep, and the next day would be the same as usual.

Thud. Thud.

The ground shook at the entrance where Peope was heading. Someone was coming in.

Peope's face turned pale just by hearing the sound.

It was clearly a giant, even though only a shadow was visible. How big was it if it shook the ground like that?

A giant appeared at the entrance.

Contrary to what she expected, he was not very big.

He was barely over two meters tall, which was less than a dwarf by the standards of giants.

However, judging by his clothing, he seemed to have a fairly high level of Ilhwa's alcohol.

He had broad shoulders and a developed lower jaw. His arms were as hard as rocks and his eyes were gleaming.

Peope realized the identity of the giant through her original knowledge and forgot to flap her wings. She barely regained her balance and flew up just before falling.

'My God... Who am I looking at?'

It was Imir, the king of giants.

Despite his small size, the ground shook because his muscles were so heavy.

He was said to have destroyed several worlds with his physical strength alone after entering Ilhwa's alcohol with more than 10,000 humans. He was the strongest giant in history.

Imir's pace quickened as he spotted Peope.

The status of giants was lower than that of angels or Mara, but Imir was different.

According to original knowledge, he was a being who had more than intermediate angelic power with simple brute force alone.

Peope swallowed her saliva and waited for Imir to come.

When he stopped with a thud, she greeted him without knowing it.

"Ah-ah-ah, hello."

Peope regretted her rash judgment.

Giants were fifth thousand Matei and fairies were fourth thousand Makonim, but in reality they were in a balanced relationship between law and faith.

Therefore, fairies did not need to bow to giants and rather they always checked each other and badmouthed each other when they met.

"Who are you?"

"Ah, I'm Peope, the spirit of Naseon."

Peope swallowed her saliva again. She didn't know what kind of mischief the giant would do to her, who had an antagonistic relationship with him.

But contrary to her expectations, Imir welcomed her warmly.

"I see, I've heard of you. They said a weirdo was born in Fairyland, and it's you."

It was news to her. It must have been a conversation between higher laws.

By the way, what a weirdo. What did he do to get such an evaluation from the higher-ups?

"You look cute. So, what brought you all the way to Aravot?"

"Oh, I'm on a proxy mission for Fairy Chief Ee-gi-rin."

Peo-peo lied like that. Of course it was true, but he felt guilty for selling out Ee-gi-rin.

But now was the time to use any connections he didn't have to defuse the situation.

"I see. I heard that Ikasa came to Shama-in. They captured the heretics, right?"

"Yes, it seems like that. By the way, do you know what happened to the women who were taken away?"

Peo-peo wanted to slap his lips that moved differently from his thoughts.

What's the point of asking that now?

He had already done everything he could and he just had to go home.

But contrary to his mind, his ears were perked up to catch Imir's words.

"They seem to be in Kariel's laboratory. They said they found a metagate. That's why the World War is noisy. That's why I came here to beg La. To give me back my body."

"Oh, I see. But noisy?"

"They said they remembered the coordinates they lost in the metagate. I'm not interested in complicated stories, but there will be a war soon. So let's fight together when the war starts. No enemy will touch you if you're by my side."

"Ah, yes. I'll do that."

Imir smiled with his eyes and passed by Peo-peo. Thump, thump, the ground started shaking again.

Peo-peo was able to breathe a sigh of relief only after he disappeared into a fragment of light.

"Phew, I got through it somehow."

He was ashamed of being scared of a giant, but he could say he was proud against Imir.

He tried to rationalize it like that... but honestly, it was a memory he wanted to erase.

Peo-peo shook his head and left Aravot. The route to Shama-in was quickly drawn in his head.

But he was looking elsewhere. His mind was confused again.

World War. Metagate. War.

He hadn't thought of those words since he woke up from the liquor of enlightenment.

Peo-peo wandered around in conflict. He wanted to run away, but he knew he shouldn't.

He heard Shirone's voice in his head.

-You'll be a great fairy for sure.

Peo-peo clenched his head and shook it. But he couldn't easily shake off the words that were stuck in his mind.

"Aw, really! I'm going crazy!"

Peo-peo flew away at high speed. A fairy headed for Jebul, the resting place of angels.

@

Anke La was staying at the top of Aravot's spire.

An omnipotent being who could freely control the lifespan of the gods and even their memories.

Imir climbed up the tower to meet that great being.

The king of giants, Imir.

The strongest giant in heaven's history.

The liquor of enlightenment is divided into 10 final stages until reaching the perfection of life. And Imir was the only giant in history who reached the unprecedented final 10th stage.

Even Imir, who was such a giant, couldn't help but feel nervous when he faced the throne of God where Anke Ra was staying.

The top floor that soared as if to pierce the sky was not even one hundredth of the area of the first floor.

All he saw when he arrived on the light elevator was a crude iron gate.

"Anke Ra, your servant Alhyeon requests your presence."

Imir waited for a while.

The iron gate started to tremble and then a crack opened in the center and it opened inward.

Imir moved his steps smoothly.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

A swelling sound was heard regularly. It was like a loose drum being hit with a sound that was swallowed inward.

It was a room that was not even 100 square meters.

Thin bundles of nerves like hair filled the gaps in the floor and spread out in all directions, and hoses that looked like windows hung from the walls.

The nerves on the floor rose up and touched Imir's ankles, but soon lost interest and fell away.

Imir knelt on one knee in front of Ra.

"The giant Imir greets Anke Ra."

Thump. Thump. Thump.

The huge lump of flesh behind Imir's shoulder greeted him by beating like a heart.

Weight 26 tons. It was reddish-brown covered with mucus, and its appearance was featureless and collapsed.

The central part was bulging, while the end was like a stretched balloon.

From the end, bundles of windows stretched out and filled the wall, and from there, nerves stretched out and expanded on the floor, waving like waves.

Ra's flesh looked like all the organs that make up a living thing were combined.

It was both a heart and a brain, a digestive system and a sensory system.

Ra's nerves began to run wild around Imir. Then the central part of the lump of flesh swelled up and then tore apart horizontally with a pop. The skin opened up and down, revealing a huge pupil.

Anke Ra (the immortal Ra, date unknown).

The iris of the pupil, which was the size of a human face, narrowed and widened, focusing.

Then a high-pitched sound that pierced the eardrum leaked out.

"Squeak! Giant... squeak! Imir, why did you... squeak! Come to see me."

Imir did not change his expression at all despite the noise that sounded like scratching nails on a steel plate.

"Heresies have entered the holy heaven. Those who cheated on Ilhwa's liquor were handed over to Kariel and are preparing to receive Saenghwa's liquor."

"I know... that."

Ra's voice stabilized a little. It was still high-pitched, but no longer mixed with noise.

Ra knows everything. So Imir judged that he had not heard an answer yet. But no matter how long he waited, nothing came out of Ra.

"What is your intention?"

"Nothing. Do I... need to care?"

"It is an unusual event. The coordinates of the world that could not be infiltrated until now are recorded in Metagate. This is a golden opportunity to convey Ra's will."

"Imi-r."

The tone of Ra's voice dropped sharply during the three syllables, followed by a majestic voice.

"I am the beginning and end of the world. Everything is connected to me, so I don't need to care about anything."

Imir clenched his lips tightly.

Ra is omnipotent. Therefore, any event would be included in his domain. But he couldn't retreat without regaining his body.

"I want to get my body back. Please melt the ice wall that never melts."

"Imir, weren't you my servant?"

"Don't misunderstand me. The giant is one who obeys the law. This is also to keep the law of heaven."

"I refuse."

Imir lifted his head with burning eyes. But when he faced Ra's huge eye, all his emotions scattered.

"A giant's one step may be louder than a billion heretics' impious actions. Especially if that step belongs to Imir, the king of giants."

"Do you doubt my loyalty? Do you think I will raise a flag against you, who are great?"

"Ymir, do not be wronged. Your power breaks the balance of the world. Do not forget that the law exists to maintain the whole."

With those words, he closed his eyes. The gaps in the mucous membrane healed without a trace, and the strength of the heartbeat increased.

Thump. Thump. Thump.
