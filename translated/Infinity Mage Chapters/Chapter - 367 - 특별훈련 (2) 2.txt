"Thank you, Isabel. We'll return the books as soon as possible." Plu said with a smile.

Isabel nodded and handed them the books. "No problem. Just make sure to take good care of them. They're very valuable, you know."

Siro nodded and followed Plu out of the library. He was eager to start learning the new magic techniques.

"So, which one do you want to try first?" Plu asked him as they walked.

Siro thought for a moment and said, "I think I'll start with the laser guidance. It sounds more interesting and useful for me."

Plu nodded. "That makes sense. It's a very advanced and versatile magic. You can use it for communication, detection, or even attack. But it's also very difficult to master. You need to have precise control over the photons and their trajectories."

Siro smiled confidently. "I'm not afraid of challenges. I have the spirit particles, after all. They can help me manipulate energy more easily."

Plu looked at him with admiration. "You're amazing, Siro. You have such a rare and powerful gift. I wish I had it too."

Siro shook his head. "No, you don't need it. You're already very talented and skilled in magic. You can do things that I can't, like creating fireballs and explosions."

Plu blushed slightly. "Thanks, but I still have a lot to learn. Especially from you."

Siro felt his heart skip a beat. He liked Plu a lot, but he didn't know how to express his feelings.

He decided to change the topic and said, "Hey, do you want to go to the practice field and try out our new magic?"

Plu brightened up and said, "Sure, let's go!"

They ran towards the field, holding their books and smiling at each other.

They didn't notice that someone was watching them from behind a tree.

It was Rui Jacovin, the author of the laser guidance book.

He had a sinister grin on his face and muttered, "So, you're interested in my magic, huh? Well, you'll soon regret it. I'll show you what real laser magic can do."

He looked at the laser guidance technology magic book with an unexpected expression and asked.

"Are you sure you can do this? It's pretty hard."

"Yes. I know how to use lasers. But is it that hard?"

"It's a specialized field that they don't teach at school. Especially since it uses radio waves, it'll be unfamiliar to you."

The laser that Shirone uses is different from other magicians.

The divine particle allowed Shirone to leap over a high barrier that he could not reach at the moment, but since he had no accurate concept of the battery, the scope of application was limited.

"I'll give it a try. I want to learn laser for sure this time."

If the person himself said so, Isabel had no reason to stop him.

"Well, using photons as an offensive magic is a rare case, so you must be greedy. If you have any questions while studying, ask me. The president of the association ordered me to teach you even if it was tutoring."

He was grateful for Gaold's consideration, but also creepy.

He really believed that Shirone could develop magic that would destroy heaven.

"Yes, thank you. I'll be back soon."

"Haha! Okay. Come anytime."

Shirone, who had already teased him so that he wouldn't be embarrassed later, got on the elevator.

The iron door of the magic library closed before the elevator.

As always, he felt like he had gone to another dimension.

* * *

Shirone got a personal training ground with Flue's help. Strictly speaking, it was Gaold's order.

It wasn't as spacious as an underground bunker, but it was enough space to spread out the spirit zone and run around by himself.

There was a sleeping capsule installed in the corner, and the floor material was the same as the training ground 2000. It seemed that he could analyze magic from various angles by operating the simulation device.

Shirone sat on the cold floor and opened the shotgun movement magic book.

He quickly read from beginning to end and closed the book and organized his thoughts in his head.

"Hmm, it seems easy and difficult."

The key is the connection speed of passive magic and active magic. As soon as teleportation is cast, photons must be fired in all directions. The principle is simple, but the connection speed must feel almost simultaneous to have value as a skill.

"Shall we try it once?"

Shirone entered the training ground and cast photonization magic. He twitched his body with a familiar sensation and the scenery in front of him pushed in like a wrinkle.

Shirone, who arrived 10 meters ahead, looked at the ceiling and was lost in thought. He originally intended to cast shotgun movement, but it didn't even activate.

"Oh, I see."

When teleportation is activated, the slot is empty. But the speed of movement was too fast to have time to cast photon output.

'Does that mean I need to replace the battery much faster?'

Then Shirone had a long-term advantage. It was time division.

Shirone, who caught a thread in that direction, tried shotgun movement based on time division.

Around sunset, he slowly got a feeling. He recovered his mental strength for about an hour in the middle of the sleep device and unfolded magic with his best concentration as if he sprinted at the end.

Finally, flashes were fired in eight directions at the same time as teleportation.

Shirone, who moved northward along the root of shotgun movement's mood, looked back and couldn't hide his excitement.

"I did it! I did it!"

"What did you do?"

Shirone turned his head toward the door.

Flue leaned against the wall crookedly and crossed her arms. Her expression was sullen, as if she was not in a good mood.

"Huh? Senior, when did you come?"

"Just now. But what did you do earlier?"

"What do you mean? Of course it's shotgun movement."

"Hmm, really?"

Flue moved her steps into the training ground.

She stopped about 10 meters away from Shirone and looked around as if checking her coordinates, then turned her head and said.

"Do it again. I'll evaluate you."

As Flue came out firmly, Shirone was also a little worried.

But even if I think about it, the buckshot movement I unfolded was exactly as written in the magic book.

"Yes. Then let's start with the basic route first...."

"No. There's no need for that. Do the intermediate course. Go wherever you want out of the eight directions. You seemed to be able to do that much when I saw you earlier."

It was a compliment, but it didn't sound like a compliment.

Anyway, since he was just learning, Shirone had no burden of failure.

'Let's go southeast.'

As Shirone concentrated, Flue crossed her arms and waited for the magic to be demonstrated.

'Buckshot Movement!'

Shirone's body was dyed gold and a flash of light exploded at the same time.

He arrived exactly at the southeast point 10 meters away and clenched his fist.

'Success, success.'

He was momentarily intoxicated with joy, but Shirone startled and lifted his upper body.

Flue, who had arrived in front of him, stretched out both arms and grabbed Shirone's shoulders.

Her eyes were half-closed calmly as if she had subdued a terrorist.

She was usually a nagging annoying sister, but at times like this she was a certified 8th grade magician.

"Uh, there...."

"Do you know what your problem is now?"

The buckshot movement was a success in terms of shape. But Flue found exactly herself out of the eight flashes.

Not only that, but she moved faster than the caster and blocked the way.

"Is it because my connection is too slow?"

Then Flue let go of Shirone's shoulders.

"That's right. I can't see it with my eyes, but I can intuitively feel it with my spirit zone. Especially for a manipulation-type magician like me, the delay becomes clearer."

"But I did my best."

"It's not a matter of effort. In fact, your connection was great just now. I think you changed it at a speed comparable to split-second...."

Flue paused for a moment and said with confidence.

"But that's the problem."

Shirone tilted his head.

Split-second is a way of thinking that changes two batteries at high speed in one slot.

There can be slower thoughts, but there can be no faster changes than this.

"If there is a delay even at split-second speed, how do I do it?"

"Collide."

"Huh?"

"Collide. Don't detach the teleportation magic, hit it with photon output magic and blow it away. And at the same time as you blow it away, you put photon output magic in the slot."

Flue clenched both fists and pushed them forward.

When she hit her left hand with her right hand, her left hand flew away and her right hand took its place.

It was an image expression of the explanation just before.

"This way you finish detaching and attaching at the same time. Then the mechanism will be shortened, right? You have to be able to do this in the realm of thought. Hitting an existing thought with a new thought. Magicians call this 'force'."

Flue showed the process again. But this time she expressed the real feeling by colliding her two fists almost close together.

A bang sound effect came out of her mouth.

"Do you understand? You skip the detachment process and just hit it and go in. You have to know how to do force if you want to work on site someday. Passive active connection is used regardless of type."

Shirone listened blankly. Bounce one thought off another?

Ordinary people never think like this. But for magicians, it was a very efficient way of thinking.

**Do you want me to explain more about force?**

"Force... I didn't even know such a thing existed."

"Of course. This is a practical skill. They don't teach it at school."

"Is it dangerous?"

"No, it's just unstable. You have to collide your thoughts and fit them precisely into the slot. It relies a lot on your senses, so it's not something that can be included in the regular curriculum. Time-sharing is also a professional skill. You're amazing for learning it by yourself. You'll probably be able to learn force soon too."

Shirone regained her confidence at Flue's words. Although her first attempt at the scatter movement ended in failure, learning a new skill that she couldn't learn at school was an achievement.

The key was force.
