[590] The Incident of That Day (1)

The twelfth island of the Mediterranean, the Kingdom of Roblang.

This small country with a population of 700,000 boasts beautiful scenery, with 70% of its citizens working in the tourism industry.

A secret meeting of politicians, whose names are well-known just by hearing them, was taking place in a hotel here, a world-renowned resort and tax haven for the rich.

Marika Hotel, basement level 2 bar.

"Cheers!"

At a table where six were joined together, 14 people were tilting their glasses.

At the center was Miro, the most famous person in the world, yet a woman whose identity was unknown.

"One more drink!"

"Are you challenging me?"

"Of course. We're not there yet!"

As Miro boldly raised her hand, the men burst into laughter.

"This lady is not an ordinary drinker. Good! Kadun, pour one more."

"Leave it to me!"

Kadun, a man who had set up a thousand glasses, climbed onto the table and poured alcohol like a waterfall from the bottles in both hands.

As the two types of liquid filled up, creating foam, and Miro grabbed the empty cup, the room became quiet in an instant.

Every time Miro's throat moved, the audience's eyes were filled with color.

Everyone stood up at the moment the last sip went down, and Miro, who put down the cup with a bang, stepped on two chairs and pulled her fist to her side.

"Cheers!"

The sound of 14 people shouting at the same time shook the bar.

"Miro, you're lucky."

"Huh?"

Miro, who turned her head, found Sein, who had somehow entered the bar, and blushed.

"Hey, my friend! What brings you here?"

As if drunk, Miro's face was flushed.

"Cheers!"

Someone must have started another round.

Listening to the cheers coming through the wall, Miro flopped down on the bed.

"Ah, I'm drunk. I must have drunk too much vodka."

She wasn't even curious about what vodka was.

"Is the job going well?"

At Sein's question, Miro pointed to the ceiling.

"It's on the 14th floor. It seems like the discussion is going to be long. It looks like it will take another two days to reach a conclusion."

Sein pulled out a chair and sat down.

"It's good to enjoy, but be careful. There are many who are after you."

"Hehe, who dares to attack me?"

There are few people in the world who can harm Miro, but seeing her disheveled appearance today, she felt a little worried.

'Well, she's been locked up for 20 years.'

Miro, who was originally free-spirited, seemed to have exploded uncontrollably.

'Maybe the world's greatest troublemaker has been released.'

Miro asked.

"But what's the matter? You came in person. Is there a problem?"

"A little. Fermi came to see me."

Miro smiled meaninglessly.

"He took the blueprints of Istas. Of course, the blueprint with the door of Gepin."

"Ha, I knew he would."

"Your words were sent to Armin, but is it really okay?"

"Of course. What could happen?"

"Infinite cyclic structure of space-time. It's an event that Gepin wanted to protect in any way. If an external factor interferes and the event is twisted, the world could be destroyed."

Despite the terrifying remark, Miro was silent.

"What the hell is it? The incident that happened in Istas."

"I don't know."

Sein tilted his head.

"You don't know?"

"I must have experienced something in Istas. But it's not in my memory. It disappeared with Gepin's erasure. I can only vaguely guess now that I've experienced the world."

"Is that why you didn't step in yourself?"

"There's a 19-year-old me in the upper part of Istas. If the event is twisted in any way, this world will be different from what we knew. That's why I told Fermi to give him the blueprint."

Miro's eyes were distant.

"If the history of the world is twisted, it's up to the parties involved to destroy it."

"Is Shiro included in that party?"

"Could be."

Sein, lost in thought, asked.

"Who is Shiro? Is he of Gepin's bloodline?"

"I don't know. The only one who knows the answer is me from 19 years ago."

Sein poured a drink and handed it to Miro.

"Isn't it about running away?"

Miro, who received the glass, raised his eyebrows.

"Running away?"

"Yolga's words."

"I told you. I don't have any memories of that time."

"But you must have memories before you entered the upper level, right?"

Sein was persistent.

"Yes."

Miro recalled Yolga's face.

"She was a lovely, affectionate sister who perfectly fits the adjectives of a good person. Can there really be anyone in the world who dislikes Yolga?"

"And then she went missing."

Sein approached Miro.

"What are the chances that you killed her?"

"Hehe, do you really want to know that?"

"I'm just worried about you. Why did Gepin choose you instead of Yolga? If she was such a good person."

"Because she was a good person."

Miro downed the strong drink in one gulp.

"Maybe I killed her. But even if I could turn back time, my judgment would be the same."

The drunkenness completely disappeared from Miro's eyes looking at Sein.

"I killed her because she deserved to die. It was right for me to become Gepin's successor."

From early morning, the graduation class was busy.

The participants of the Scramble Royal joined another fierce competition, and only a few people left the school for personal reasons.

The representative figures were Nade and Kaiden.

The winning team was determined to make up for the 7 days of absence, and the losing team had to discreetly prepare an alternative to lower the score than Nade.

'Just lower it until the graduation exam. The best result is to be 1 point behind Nade.'

The problem was that they didn't know when Nade would return.

"Don't worry. I just need some time to think."

Eruki, his closest friend, reassured Amy like that.

On the other hand, Shiro, who refused the evaluation, left the dormitory early in the morning and arrived at the meeting place.

Anchale, without an eye patch, was waiting.

"Did you unseal it?"

"I brought the magic eye to do that. What about Arman?"

Shiro answered by showing the cubic.

"Now tell me. What does it mean that Gepin is in the upper level?"

"I'll explain on the way."

When Anchale turned his body to Istas, Shiro refused.

"No. I need to hear the explanation first. Going together is after that."

Anchale, who checked the time, turned around.

"Okay. It's a matter of life and death for you too."

Anchale reconstructed the situation that could have happened in Istas 19 years ago and told it.

"Gepin... was here?"

"Isn't it obvious? You've seen Gepin's door too."

Even so, it didn't feel real to hear it.

The gap between the person who was erased from everyone's memory and the magician who everyone in the world knew 19 years ago could not be easily narrowed.

"It is estimated that among the people who were lurking in Istas to chase Miro at that time, Yolga's party was also included."

"Yolga?"

"The mother of Fermi."

"Ah......"

"The sure thing is that a secret force, Mars, belonging to the Gimudae, secretly sent troops from the Torumia Kingdom to kill Miro. Each one is a powerful assassin."

Shiro recalled the scene he saw through the time bomb explosion in Istas.

"There was definitely... the mark of the Torumia Kingdom."

"The upper level of Istas does not open unless a very complicated condition is met. But your ability to control time ignored that condition and brought up the incident of the past. This will help in some way."

Anchale asked last.

"Are you going with me? My explanation ends here."

Shiro, who had been lost in thought, finally raised his head.

Roar! Roar!

In the building of Istas, which changes its structure while being whimsical, Fermi and Lycon were having a conversation.

"The upper part is only open in a specific structure. In the end, you need a stop magic."

"Very meticulous."

"It's not just meticulous. It's not a place made for exploration in the first place."

"The time of infinite cyclic structure."

It still didn't come to Lycon as reality.

"If there really is such a thing, you could have everything in the world."

What he was focusing on was not the incident of Istas, but time itself.

"Yes. The event keeps repeating. We are not exceptions. Therefore……."

Fermi threw a bead that emits red light.

"It means that you can duplicate as many items as you want."

Lycon, who caught the bead, looked puzzled.

"Didn't you say 10 billion gold?"

"That's worth 10 billion gold."

"This? It doesn't look like a jewel. Is it an objet?"

"Correct. &lt;The Last Scream of the Yeager Family&gt;. I bought it at the Curia auction for twice the market price."

"Twice? Then it's a loss. The price of the objet is high because it is rare, but if you copy it……."

"Of course, but &lt;The Last Scream of the Yeager Family&gt; is an exception. It sends a signal with a sound when the owner is in danger. It's a consumable item and it's closely related to life, so if you duplicate it into hundreds, you'll make a fortune in no time."

"Hmm, I see."

Lycon was finally satisfied.

"Move along the set coordinates and then come back to this warehouse and put it in this safe."

Fermi pointed to a sturdy safe.

"Then the event will continue to repeat and accumulate. However, you have to be careful. The skills of those involved in this incident are not ordinary. It's best to bypass space."

"Hehe, it doesn't matter."

Lycon pulled up his rubber tights to cover his nose.

'I'm sure of my skills.'

The eldest son of Gunjo Bedium, who is rated as the strongest hitman in the Black Line, was Gunjo Lycon.

With that trust, Fermi asked.

"What are you going to do when you make a fortune?"

"Charity."

"Haha! What?"

Fermi thought Lycon was a bigger villain than himself.

"It's fun, isn't it? Villain philanthropist. It's about giving a shot to those hypocrites who are just verbose."

Lycon said, loosening his neck joints.

"Do you know why people think they are right? It's all because of the damn imagination. They delude themselves into thinking they've actually done something they haven't experienced."

Fermi was listening with interest.

"In the imagination, if you don't want to die, you can cut off your own feet. But in reality, when you give a saw, you can't even bring it to your ankle. That's the blind spot of imagination. It lacks pain."

Lycon does not imagine.

"I also do murder outsourcing, but I honestly think it's not a good behavior. Because if I kill someone, others can kill me."

"That's a social contract."

"But my father fed our family with murder outsourcing. If he hadn't killed people, I would have been more miserable."

"Not everyone commits murder, right?"

"They don't commit it either. The point is, if you're not willing to bear my pain, shut up. Don't exert your imagination."

Fermi smirked.

"You're a villain in the world, Lycon."

"Hehe, that's why I like you. I thought I could make a fortune from the beginning if I worked with you."

"Get out, Electric Monster."

Electricity flowed through Lycon's body, and in an instant, his figure evaporated with a crackling sound.

"Shall we start now?"

Fermi, who confirmed that the structure of Istas had stopped operating, left the warehouse.

It was time to cast a stop spell.

"The location of the structure has changed."

"Shirone, who arrived at Istas with Anchar, muttered with a serious expression.

It wasn't just that it had changed, the key was that it was a structure he had seen somewhere.

'It's the structure at the time when Gepin's door was opened.'

“It seems that Fermi has already entered.”

After carefully examining the surface of Istas, Anchar turned to look at Shirone.

"Are you ready? Once you step in, you may never be able to return."

Shirone swallowed and nodded.

"Good. Then let's get started."

The door to the warehouse opened, and the two slowly pushed their bodies in.

This is an event that actually existed 19 years ago but was erased from the memory of everyone in the world.

It's a record of 2 hours and 48 minutes."
