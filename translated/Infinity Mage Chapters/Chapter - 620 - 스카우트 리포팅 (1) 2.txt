[620] Scout Reporting (1)

- Extreme Survival Evaluation Stage 1 begins. A Tier 10 monster will be summoned at random.

As soon as the two-thousand system was activated, the students entered the Spirit Zone.

'Extreme survival...'

Among the students, it was known as a subject that was difficult to judge in terms of likes and dislikes, and it was a method of annihilating creatures from Tier 10 to Tier 1, which are listed in the Red Line Biological Dictionary, over 10 stages.

"Gather in the center!"

Without anyone leading, all 30 students gathered in the center of the Colosseum, and the two-thousand system summoned creatures living in the natural environment of the wilderness at random coordinates.

"What...!"

The veterans of the graduating class had experienced all six subjects, but more than half of them were experiencing extreme survival for the first time.

- 1,429 Tier 10 creatures summoned.

The core mission is to annihilate the enemy, but it is still extreme survival.

Insects, beasts, reptiles, all kinds of vicious things filled the wide Colosseum in an instant, making them shiver.

"Here they come!"

As if the earth was shaking, all the creatures rushed towards the students.

"Hehe, as a service..."

When Fermi's blizzard caused a snowstorm throughout the radius, the remaining students cast their own major magic.

The light of all colors dazzled the eyes for a moment, and 1,429 creatures disappeared just 3 seconds after they appeared.

- Stage 1 ends. Stage 2 will begin in 30 seconds.

The time given to annihilate each stage is 10 minutes.

If it exceeds 10 minutes, the next creature will be summoned immediately regardless of the remaining creatures, but if it is annihilated within the time limit, a 30-second rest time is given.

The eyes and hands of the scouts from all over the world were busy, and Baikal, Elizabeth, and Lara of the Torumia Magic Association Scout Team started their work.

A fire entered the retina of Elizabeth, who was wearing a bracelet connected to the two-thousand main system.

"The annihilation time is 3.24 seconds. The total magical power is 23,409 magical. The highest figure is Fermi's 11,000 magical, and the lowest figure is Eden's 0 magical."

The note floating in the air in Lara unfolded, and the pen moved quickly through the writing magic.

"Hmm, 11,000 magical."

It was difficult to get the students' discernment in the first stage of extreme survival, but it was definitely noteworthy that they controlled the magic accurately.

"Participant number 1, Arduino Fermi. He controlled the magic of the ten thousand units without error."

"He must have done it on purpose, right?"

Baikal nodded at Lara's question.

"He knows that he only checks the highest score in the first stage. He got the attention of all the scouts in 3 seconds."

"He's a veteran. He has good grades every year. There are rumors that he dropped out on purpose."

The evaluator combines the opinions of the analyst and the record keeper to give an overall grade.

It is updated in real time, but since scouts are also people, it was most important to leave a good first impression.

"Judgment pending."

But Baikal was relaxed.

"We didn't come here to see just this, did we?"

As soon as he entered the third stage, a Tier 9 creature revealed itself.

The number of individuals exceeded 1,000, and as a creature at the top of the food chain in the habitat, it was on average twice the size of Tier 10.

"Get ready!"

From a leopard with sharp teeth to a monkey with sharp claws, as soon as the beasts that ordinary people wouldn't dare to hunt rushed, the power of magic soared even more.

Fire, cold, lightning, and light were brilliantly mixed, and the spectacle lasted for tens of seconds.

"Annihilation time 46.22 seconds."

"It's definitely fast."

The average annihilation time of the second stage known to Baikal was 1 minute 32 seconds.

"The total magical power is 76,530 magical. The person who recorded the highest score is Fermi with 22,000."

"He's an interesting guy."

Baikal's appreciation was all that.

"We're entering the third stage. It's going to be a little different now."

"From the 8th tier, it includes creatures from the monster system that have diverged from the animal kingdom.

If up to the 2nd stage is simply fighting strong animals, from the 3rd stage, it was a collection of monsters that you hardly ever meet unless you deliberately go out and find them.

Roar!

'Ulkda!'

It's the monster that Shirona first grafted the particles of God into photon output, but the numbers pouring in from all sides exceeded two hundred.

In the sky, the monster Tycoon was flying around making strange noises, and under the ground, the giant scorpion Scorpion was charging, swinging its 2-meter-long tail and moving its legs like a beetle.

Blizzard was inevitably laid, but unlike before, only the activity was slightly weakened.

'There won't be any fools falling at the 3rd stage...'

From this point where the difficulty level drastically increases in the long-term perspective, it was important to manage mental strength, and the participants' heads began to turn complicatedly.

'Saint Barrier!'

As the encirclement narrowed to a certain distance, Eden's shield spread out as a spherical curtain in the midst of the students' glances.

"Participant number 25. Chandler Eden. Magical power value 30,842 magical. Standard longitude 307.5."

"Okay. What about durability?"

"When measured in standard strength, it is 27 press per millimeter."

"Ho?"

Elizabeth's eyebrows twitched.

"I will increase the magical power value. 38,000 magical. 45,000 magical. 69,000 magical...."

As the Saint Barrier expanded to a diameter of 20 meters, the encirclement widened as if pushing out the millet.

"Standard longitude 1,209. Standard strength is 87 press per millimeter. The efficiency of magic power reaches 187 percent."

The fact that it produced nearly twice the power with a single magic power was a truly tremendous omnipotence.

"The omnipotence of faith?"

Baikal commented.

"Grade D. Overprotection. No matter how high the efficiency is, it's useless if the way of thinking is consumptive."

Lara recorded the real-time grade on Eden's page.

"Hurry up! Are you just going to watch?"

As Eden shouted, the participants immediately moved to action.

'Chet! If you pull too far back, it won't be good for the evaluation.'

There were those who showed off their skills in the meantime, and the one who showed the most brilliant action was the magic gunner Screamer.

"Destroy everything!"

Every time he rushed between monsters with teleportation and poured out attacks, the Ulks vomited blood and fell.

"Participant number 10, Logan Screamer!"

Elizabeth's analysis began to speed up.

"Teleportation cycle 124 RPM! Compulsion error 0.9 percent! Average distance 10 meters 3.4 centimeters!"

"Grade C. He's lost in self-admiration."

"Participant number 4! Carmis Amy! Firepower coefficient 2.4! Heat 875 degrees Celsius! Aiming accuracy 97 percent!"

"Participant number 14 Victor Sabina! Firing speed 7.9 times per second! Cutting strength......!"

The sound of scouts from all over the world analyzing the ins and outs of the participants in each country's language overwhelmed the audience.

"......It's brutal."

Lian muttered, watching the VIP seats.

Even Reina, who was attending the magic school graduation exam for the first time, was tired of their power.

'That's what it's like to be evaluated by those people.'

The fact that they value not just the skill of magic, but everything about the participant, was the harsh reality of this world.

When Ollina, who was watching her son's battle, covered her face with both hands, Vincent, who heard her sobbing, supported her shoulder with his hand.

'Honey, my heart feels like it's going to burst, too.'

He took in his son, who was fiercely deploying magic.

What grade would those competent people give to Shirona?

At first, she was out of her mind at the scene that surpassed her imagination, but in the end, all the senses of a parent are focused only on the child.

'Shirona, was this the world you dreamed of?'

He was a son who had never shown his feelings even when he tried to raise him as a child of a hunter.

How desperate he must have been.

Thinking about how much heartache he must have gone through alone to get to the top of this fierce competition, his eyes turned red.

"Oh God, please let Shiro pass."

Among the many prayers going up to heaven, whose voice will God listen to?

"Annihilation time 4 minutes 55 seconds. The total magic power is 323,000 magical."

The magic power in the hundreds of thousands was meaningless.

"That's a high total for a third stage. Who's the over-face?"

Elizabeth's gaze caught a boy.

"Highest score 110,000 magical. Participant number 27. Arian Shiro."

Baikal's eyebrows narrowed.

"I thought he wasn't a fool."

It was an unexpected move, even though he had been introduced by Flu and was expecting it.

'I have to go from now on.'

At the point where he passed the third stage, Shiro completely released his tactical limit.

30 seconds passed in an instant, and a creature of the 7th tier appeared.

With 870 individuals, it was the first time it had been reduced to hundreds, but the ability was different from the 8th tier.

There were monsters with magical properties, such as a harpy casting sound magic and a flare raptor spewing fire, and above all, they had the ability to solve the situation intellectually.

Kieeeee!

As the Flare Raptor led the charge, the survival of the extreme became a chaotic situation in an instant.

"The formation is collapsing."

The point of extreme survival is that the participants are allies and competitors.

Since the regulations end the first test when half of the participants, or 15 people, remain, a game of nerves was also a necessary condition.

'Frenzy!'

As soon as the curtain of light pushed out a massive mass, the force pushed out the whole body and the scatter movement was cast.

The scouts' eyes were focused on the sight of running around, scattering photon cannons everywhere.

"The force is fast."

Elizabeth's focus was different.

"The magic power has exceeded 220,000 magical."

"Huh? 220,000?"

Lara stopped writing and asked.

"It's still going up. 260,000 magical! 320,000 magical! 440,000 magical!"

As if to prove Elizabeth's analysis, the photon cannons firing from the sky were devastating the ground.

"440,000 magical."

It was already beyond the standard of a professional.

'It's still not enough!'

The number of monsters that Shiro was killing alone accounted for 32 percent of the total, and the number was still rising.

"What's with that student? He's doing it all by himself, isn't he?"

Even the parents had given up finding their children's positions and were captivated by Shiro's dance.

"Hmph! There's always one of those kids. The ones who run in the beginning without being able to run."

Unlike most parents who looked down on him, Iruki's father Albino was laughing.

"It's amazing. I expected it after hearing from Iruki, but honestly, I didn't expect it to be this much."

"That's right. It's still early, but so far, he's definitely standing out among the participants."

The scouts' opinions were a little different.

"It's a little strange. What happened? It says he's cautious......"

While some were focusing on the visible numbers, others were wondering about the excessive response that ignored the difficulty.

Baikal was one of them.

"Why did he make that choice? I told him that waste doesn't get good scores."

"It seems to be a personal problem."

He had a vague idea of what situation Shiro was in.

"It's a shame."

Showing power wasn't everything.

"If he was thinking of attracting scouts, he should have chosen a different method."

"Evaluator... it's going up."

Elizabeth's voice was trembling.

"The magic power is 520,000 magical. 610,000 magical. 690,000... The signal of the immortal function has been caught! 870,000! 940,000!"

'No one......'

Shiro gritted his teeth.

'You can't decide my future!'

As the photon cannon, which fired at a rate of 300 times per second, poured out, the monsters on the ground crumpled like bugs hit by a hammer.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
