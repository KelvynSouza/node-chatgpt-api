"Fine. I'll give you one last chance to challenge me. Come up here after you beat Sabina and Closer. I've already beaten Boil, so you can't complain, right? If you can win against both of them, then I'll face you."

Closer and Sabina cheered. This was a chance for Dante to get rid of Siroine. Of course, they didn't intend to lose to him either.

"No. There's no need for that."

Siroine rejected Dante's offer.

"Hey, wake up. You're in the position of a challenger. If you want to face me, you need at least...."

"Just come at me with all three of you at once. I want to finish this quickly and not worry about it anymore."

"You crazy...!"

Dante and his group were shocked. They had never been insulted like this at the Royal Magic Academy.

Nade, who was watching the situation, clicked his tongue.

"Anyway, he's good at talking trash. I'm never going to argue with Siroine."

"He's just good at making people angry. He doesn't do it because he hates it."

Iruki said that and walked into the tense scene voluntarily. He had been patient until now because Siroine didn't step up, but he didn't have a bad hobby of enjoying being ignored.

"Hey, Siroine. If it's something fun like this, let me join too."

Dante glared at Iruki, who joined in like an unwelcome guest. He was sure that he was trying to push them into a team battle because Siroine alone was too much to handle.

"Iruki, this is not your place to butt in. I can see right through your scheme."

"What are you talking about? This is my specialty. I'll take care of all of you at once. It'll take one second per person, so exactly one second in total."

Closer snorted.

"Idiot, one second per person means three seconds...."

He stopped when he realized what he meant and frowned.

"You bastards! Are you crazy? Who do you think we are? How dare you act so arrogant!"

"Why don't you try it one by one if you're confident? The conclusion is simple: whoever wins wins. Who cares who beats who or how? Why make it so complicated? Right, Dante?"

"You're misunderstanding something. I'm not saying that you should beat Siroine and come up to me. I'm saying that you should prove your qualifications if you want to challenge me."

"My qualifications are enough. If I beat Siroine, no one else will dare to challenge you."

Iruki pointed at the students who were watching the situation.

"See? There's no need to think too complicated. If you beat us, you're the best. You'll dominate the advanced class. And that's probably your mission from someone."

He hit the nail on the head. If he was Iruki, who had been in the Royal Magic Academy, he would know Olivia's strategy.

Even if he didn't know, he would have sensed that she was involved in why they were acting so violently.

Now that their cards were revealed, Dante didn't hide it either.

"Fine. Let's do a team battle. We can't interfere with the classes, so we'll have an unofficial match on the weekend. We'll fight one person per week and whoever gets two wins first wins. If you lose two times first, then I don't even need to fight Siroine and I win by default. Do you accept?"

"Sure. If you want to keep up appearances until the end, do that. I'll win anyway. You won't even have a chance to avoid fighting Siroine."

"Hmph, you talk big. Then add one more person to your side too. Anyone is fine. Call Boil or something."

"That would be boring. We have our own line too."

Iruki turned his head. Nade pointed at himself with a dumbfounded expression.

He didn't mind helping Siroine, but he didn't expect to be dragged into a battle. But he couldn't refuse now and break Siroine's momentum.

As Nade walked over, Dante tilted his head.

"Nade? Are you sure about that?"

He didn't seem very impressive based on what he had seen so far. His grades weren't very good and he didn't show any strengths during the practical evaluations.

But Iruki used the word line. He had received a mission to crush Siroine,

Nade, who arrived at the battlefield, whispered to Iruki.

"Hey, what are you thinking? What if I lose because of you?"

"Just fill in the numbers. I'll take care of everything."

While the two were whispering, Dante went to the teachers. He had heard the conversation from beginning to end, so he didn't need to explain anything.

"I want to settle this. I request that you open the 2000th practice field on the weekend."

Shiina spoke as the representative.

"It's not our decision, but we'll review it. Go back and wait."

The students stopped practicing and waited anxiously. It was a historic event that Shirone threw down the gauntlet, but if the school didn't approve, the duel would go up in smoke.

When all the teachers in charge of the 2000th gathered, Shiina said.

"So this is how it turned out. Was it bound to happen sooner or later?"

Sade shook his head.

"I disagree. We shouldn't let another student judge a student's mistake. We'll open a disciplinary committee and announce the fact that Pandora harmed him."

Etela, who had been chin-stroking and lost in thought, said.

"Hmm, I agree with some of what Mr. Sade said. But I think the expression 'judgment' is too harsh. Can't we interpret it as a self-regulation among students?"

"I'm not ignorant of the importance of autonomy. But this is a duel. It's strange that students fight each other with magic and decide the outcome."

"Even so, Boil and Dante have already settled it. Many students are dueling right now. I think opening the 2000th on the weekend is no different from the concept of supplementary classes."

Shiina thought Sade's opinion was right. But he also understood Etela's desire to leave it to Shirone. He knew it, that Sade's words wouldn't go through at school.

"We have different opinions, so we have no choice but to bring in a realistic problem. If we refuse, Dante will propose it to Principal Olivia. What do you think she will decide?"

A sputtering sound came from Sade's throat. Olivia would definitely allow it. He didn't know why, but he felt like she had been aiming for this from the beginning. Besides, Alpheus told him to follow her words unconditionally. What on earth did his master think when he brought Olivia into the school?

"Teachers are us. Are you saying we should trust Shirone in this situation? Why?"

"Because Principal Olivia trusts Dante. And Principal Alpheus trusts Shirone. Looking back now, this doesn't seem like just a problem between students."

Etela said.

"I want to trust him too. Just like I'm a teacher and a monk, Shirone is also a student but has the spirit of a monk who pursues goodness. Maybe that's why Principal Alpheus left everything to Principal Olivia?"

Sade was lost in thought. Now that he thought about it, it was definitely strange. No matter how great his master was, he couldn't have invited Jerome Olivia, the best teacher in the kingdom.

There must have been something solid behind it.

'How can you cause more trouble than your disciple, Master?'

Sade sighed and walked over to the students. And he announced the first result of Dante's request.

"As a result of an emergency meeting, we agreed to open the 2000th and allow unofficial one-on-one combat training."

The students cheered as if they were about to leave. Thanks to that, Sade's words that they needed approval from above were buried.

There was no need to bring them up anyway.

"Awesome! This is a big deal!"

"Finally! Shirone and Dante! Dante and Shirone! Wow!"

The students couldn't control their blood and ran around.

In a place where all kinds of shouts were roaring, Iruki tapped one person's shoulder and pointed at himself.

"Hey, it's not just Shirone who's fighting, I'm fighting too."

"Wow! Iruki! Did you hear? Shirone and Dante are fighting!"

"......"

The news of the confrontation spread throughout the school through the students' mouths.

In the research club of Eumji, they already distributed flyers with information about the two people and encouraged betting.

The teachers' meeting room was also noisy. All the teachers gathered to discuss how to deal with this incident.

"Let me say it again, it's dangerous. It's against the policy to solve the students' personal feelings with physical collisions."

Olivia didn't care about Sade's words.

"It's not fighting, it's choosing the best. Anyway, they are all kids who will enter the graduation class next year or the year after. You can see it as intensifying competition."

"But principal teacher! If these things continue, the school's honor will...!"

Olivia raised her hand as if to say one verse.

"Shirone and Dante's battle will be an event that attracts the attention of the whole kingdom. I will also personally propose to the teachers' association and send a special correspondent."

The meeting room became chilly. She called for a special correspondent directly from the teachers' association. Then Alpheus Magic School would receive attention from the world. And if they published an academic journal with Dante, the star of the kingdom, it would be a great benefit for the school.

Sweet fantasies floated in the teachers' heads. Alpheus Magic School, the first prestigious school in the kingdom. The best teacher who guides students there (me).

On the other hand, Sade felt bad. He always agreed to raise the school's reputation, but he didn't like using it as a tool to silence teachers.

"Principal teacher Olivia, let me say one thing."

"Sade, just proceed as it is."

"Yes, just proceed... Huh?"

Sade turned his head red.

Alpheus was standing at the back door. Because of the nature of the case, Olivia didn't even give an order to leave this time.

"As expected, Alpheus has foresight. It's a very beneficial event for the school, so it would be foolish to leave it alone."

"There must be a reason? Thanks to you, I'll also be famous in my old age. Hahaha!"

"When the confrontation is over, Dante's victory article will go out massively. I feel sorry for Shirone, who will get hurt a lot, but you're so excited by yourself."

"Ha ha! Both kids go to Alpheus Magic School, so they're like Alpheus' disciples. But I also think that we should choose the best."

Olivia's eyes narrowed. She hated that he didn't back down a word.

This time, Alpheus' eyes were also fierce. The two teachers who had devoted their lives to teaching had obtained disciples who would mark their careers, so it was a clash of decades of educational philosophy.

An hour later, the unofficial confrontation was officially approved.

6. Magic Collision (1)

The students waited for the weekend to come back.

It was the first time in nearly 10 years that Alpheus Magic School had created such a hot topic.

On the day of Shirone and Dante's confrontation, there was talk that a special correspondent would be dispatched from the teachers' association.

The boys joked about making outrageous pranks to make their presence known to the world, and the girls worried about what to wear.

Iruki and Nade headed to the research club. They heard countless stories that they couldn't tell if they were real or fake while walking a short distance, but none of them came out of their own content.

"I didn't expect much from the beginning, but now that it's like this, I'm losing steam. Are we side dishes?"

"But they're coming anyway. There... I think I should go first?"

Nade had been worried since the match was approved.

Closer was after Iruki, so his opponent would probably be Victor Savina.

A formidable woman who accelerates with haste and sprinkles wind cutters around.

She was a skilled person who could enter the top 20 in the country except for the graduation class, so it was bound to be a tough fight regardless of compatibility.
