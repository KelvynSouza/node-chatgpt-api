[517] The Nameless Prosecutor (1)

The border area between the kingdoms of Biden and Peris was a dangerous place where local wars broke out constantly even after the armistice agreement.

But it was also a perfect place for prosecutors who wanted to gain real experience.

Lafne village, a little more biased towards Biden on the border.

A prosecutor crossed the entrance of the village.

His physique, which had both agility and strength, proved that his muscles were not made for mere looks, and the huge straight sword he carried on his back testified to that fact.

A knight trainee who dropped out of Kaizen Swordsmanship School and wandered around the world to gain real experience, Ogent Lian.

"Damn it...."

A sound like scraping metal came out of his completely dry throat.

He wandered around the world looking for a battlefield and became a mercenary on Biden's side and fought local wars with Peris soldiers.

But the war was a wasteful battle that was made through a secret negotiation between the two regional administrators to receive subsidies from the kingdom, and most of the hired mercenaries were killed to keep their mouths shut.

Lian, who was attacked by his allies in a hurry, survived and came here.

'If only I had been a little more careful....'

After all, that's what a mercenary's life is like.

The Parrot Mercenary Corps he met in Galliant also fell into a bandit group after being caught up in a noble's power struggle.

'I guess I can't beg for food here either.'

One of the reasons why the battlefield was hard was that there was no place to rest even after leaving the battlefield.

The village he arrived at now was no different, and there was no sign of food scraps rolling on the floor, let alone a market.

Many houses were in a state of not being repaired with collapsed roofs, and people's faces were dry.

'Then I have to cross the mountain tonight.'

No one will give Lian food.

They might have to give it up if he threatens them with a sword, but he had seen many knight trainees who eventually became bandits while wandering around the world.

"Hoo! Hoo!"

Suddenly, heat rose to his head and his head spun.

The wound on his side where he was hit by an arrow during the war began to throb severely.

He had emergency treatment, but he couldn't get rid of the inflammation, and he hadn't eaten anything for days, so his body had no room to endure.

Thud!

Lian squeezed out his last strength and leaned back against the wall on the side of the road and collapsed.

"Hoo-hoo!"

The breath that spewed from his throat was so hot that it seemed to melt his teeth.

"Am I dying?"

He didn't know until he boasted and ran away from Klump.

That there is no limit to bad things.

Fatigue, pain, fear, despair, and all the things that ruin humans tormented Lian.

There is no instructor who would say that's enough and stop the misfortune.

The world just says this.

If you can't stand it, die.

'Well, that's fine too.'

Lian didn't remember how he got out of the battlefield.

He just remembered himself running wild through the encirclement of soldiers from both kingdoms, screaming and bleeding.

'Death is also a good choice.'

Lian smiled faintly.

Not because he laughed, but because he wanted to check if he could still laugh.

He felt like running away from his life for the first time in endless despair.

'Death is not scary.'

It's just scary to be buried in the ground as a skeleton without accomplishing anything.

"Shirone... Tes..."

Lian blinked slowly. His vision narrowed by half every time he closed his eyelids.

"I'm sorry..."

"Mister, what's wrong with you?"

He heard a young girl's voice at the edge of his fading consciousness.

"Are you okay? Come on, wake up."

The girl's face pushing into his narrowed vision as if there was a hole in black paper was Lian's last memory.

 I'm Sydney. I live here with my mom. We don't have a dad. He died in the war.

**Lian**: I'm sorry to hear that.

**Sydney**: It's okay. Mom says he was a brave soldier who fought for our country. She says we should be proud of him.

**Lian**: She's right. Your dad was a hero.

**Sydney**: Do you think so? Thank you, mister.

**Lian**: You're welcome, kid.

**Mom**: Here, dinner is ready. It's not much, but I hope you enjoy it.

**Lian**: Thank you for your hospitality. You're very kind.

**Mom**: Don't mention it. You saved my daughter from those bandits. We owe you our lives.

**Lian**: It was nothing. I just did what I had to do.

**Sydney**: Mom, can I ask mister Lian something?

**Mom**: Sure, go ahead.

**Sydney**: Mister Lian, what is that thing you have on your back? It looks like a sword, but it's different.

**Lian**: This? This is called an Idea. It's a special weapon that only a few people can use.

**Sydney**: An Idea? Wow, that sounds cool. How does it work?

**Lian**: Well, it's hard to explain, but...

"Let go of me!"

The man grabbed Silvia's arm and dragged her towards the door. He ignored her screams and the tears in her eyes.

"Mommy!"

Liz ran after them, but another man blocked her way. He had a scarred face and a wicked grin.

"Hey, kid. You want to play with me?"

He reached out his hand to grab Liz, but before he could touch her, a sword flashed in front of his eyes.

"Get away from her!"

Lian had drawn his sword and slashed at the man's arm. Blood spurted out and the man howled in pain.

"You bastard! How dare you interfere!"

He swung his other arm at Lian, but Lian dodged and kicked him in the stomach. The man fell to the floor, clutching his wound.

Lian turned to Liz and said, "Are you okay?"

Liz nodded, still trembling. She hugged Lian's leg and said, "Thank you, big brother."

Lian smiled and ruffled her hair. He looked at the door and saw that Silvia and Fox had disappeared.

"Damn it. We have to go after them."

He sheathed his sword and picked up Liz. He ran out of the house, hoping that Silvia was still alive.```

He stopped his head in the direction of the dining table, looking around the house with a fierce look.

He was much younger and more handsome than what he had heard.

"Ho? Was that it?"
