[559] Once again, the steel door (4)

"Shirone...?"

The sound of sobbing filled the room.

Amy couldn't say anything at the sight of Shirone shedding tears sorrowfully.

"Amy."

Shirone spoke with a trembling chin.

"Feofe is dead."

It was a heart-sinking event for Amy as well.

She remembers the small and cute fairy who helped Shirone, Lian, and Tes in heaven.

And the fact that she died meant that Shirone had been to heaven.

"She died because of me. She gave her life to save me...."

She couldn't tell Miro or Elukina Nade because it was unbearable to even think about it.

But Amy knew Feofe.

"I went to find Ikael, and she was in my hands...."

As she recalled the horribly emaciated figure of Feofe, her hands began to tremble.

She could still feel her frail weight vividly.

"She said she loved me... but she was too small... I...."

Amy closed her eyes slowly.

'So that's why you didn't want to hear it.'

She knew there was no way Shirone would just leave a will and leave without any reason.

"I was so angry that I used Valhalla Action... but after that, I don't remember...."

"I got it, Shirone. You don't need to dig up painful memories."

Tears fell from Shirone's face, which was bowed down, and a sobbing voice leaked out.

"Feofe...."

Amy was torn between sadness and anger.

'Stupid, I'm the one who wants to cry.'

When Amy, who was sitting on the bed, pulled Shirone's shoulder, her face fell into her chest.

Shirone burst into tears.

As her voice pounded Amy's chest, the locked steel bars began to open little by little.

"Ha, really...."

As Amy stroked Shirone's back, she looked up at the ceiling.

'It's just once. If you do it again, I won't be shaken.'

In this way, Amy buried Shirone's sorrow in her heart.

* * *

The next morning.

Shirone headed to Istas as soon as she woke up.

Her eyes were swollen from crying too much last night, but what was more embarrassing was something else.

"Ah! Why did I do that?"

The moment she heard Amy's firm words, her heart fluttered, and from then on, she was just sad.

'But thanks to that, we made up.'

She didn't feel bad.

She still felt heartbroken when she thought of Feofe, but it was fortunate that there was someone next to her to share her sorrow.

Sometimes crying, that's how she lived on.

'I'm nervous for no reason.'

Shirone, who arrived at Istas, frowned as she recalled the sense of portrait she felt yesterday.

Istas.

A multi-purpose complex structure consisting of 89 warehouses.

It's a facility that every prestigious school has at least one, but Alpheus Magic School's Istas was special both historically and functionally.

'The door of Geopin is here.'

The origin was Sein who set the Supernatural Spirit Science Research Association as the origin, but the door was not made by them.

'It's probably a high possibility that it was some incident at the time.'

While lost in thought, she arrived at the warehouse where the entrance to Istas was installed.

'I have to investigate before lunch.'

So far, she had activated Sibulsangpokmae in the lab, but this time she was going to go directly to where the sound was heard.

"The sound came from the ceiling...."

Shirone, who calculated the coordinates through the master equation, turned her steps to the stairs.

'Hmm, it's here.'

She was scared to try it alone, but it was a courtesy to the friends who helped her to investigate a little bit in advance.

'Sibulsangpokmae.'

As the incarnation of the angel of light soared explosively and was sucked into her body, she heard a hallucination without fail.

"Captain! We can't stand it!"

"It's the same as dying anyway! Aim for the child!"
[Translated block]


Shirone, who ran to where the sound was heard, stopped with a grimace at the sight spread out in front of the corner.

"What is this?"

Bodies broken down the stairs were scattered, most of them armed with military gear, and some were wizards.

Shirone carefully examined the bodies in a terrible state that he could hardly see with his eyes.

"This is......"

The seal of the Thorumia Kingdom was engraved on the military gear.

'Why is the kingdom soldier here?'

"Surround! Block the path!"

Shirone, who raised his head at the sound from the upper floor, quickly climbed the stairs.

As if time and space had changed, the heat of the body was cut off at the last boundary of the warehouse.

Shirone, who confirmed the current coordinates with the mark on the ceiling, stopped walking and looked at the back of a woman standing tall in the middle of the shooting range.

"Miro, is it you?"

I don't know when the scene I'm seeing now happened, but it was no problem to recognize Miro, who hadn't aged nearly 20 years.

Miro, who was confronting the soldiers who had taken the front, turned her head slightly.

"Who are you?"

'Can you hear my voice?'

It's not like a hallucination.

I thought I might actually be at the scene of some event.

"Really... Are you Miro?"

Miro turned to the soldiers again.

"You seem to be a student, go back. This is not a place for you."

A moment later, she spat out a self-mocking word.

"Well, it's already a caught time."

"Huh? What is that......"

As Shirone tried to follow Miro, who was charging towards the soldiers, a group of soldiers poured in from the right corridor.

"What is it, that guy?"

"He seems to be a student! What should we do?"

"Student? How did a student get in here?"

The captain, who had been advising himself, opened his eyes in surprise.

"Kill! There's no way out anyway!"

"Take care of it!"

The soldiers' movements suddenly accelerated. They were elite soldiers who were masters of the schema at a glance.

"Kuk!"

The first thought that came to mind was whether he would be cut by their swords.

Considering that I was able to have a conversation with Miro, it didn't seem impossible, but I still didn't think this was reality.

'Stupid!'

Whether it's possible or not, isn't it a situation where you have to avoid it unconditionally?

As I cast teleportation while applying the technique of the eye, my body was entangled as if I had been caught in a net thrown from all sides.

"Kuk!"

The hallway was just quiet.

"Haah! Haah!"

With a rough breath, Shirone's body, who had her eyes wide open, slid down the wall.

'I almost died.'

Honestly, I couldn't be sure, but the feeling was too clear.

'What did I see?'

Anyway, what was certain was that I should never unfold the fire god technique here.

Meanwhile, someone's voice was faintly coming and going from a point 70 meters away from where Shirone was resting.

"What's wrong? Why is he doing that? He's glowing alone."

"Is he crazy?"

"He must be training. He teleported, didn't he?"

Only a small voice leaked out, and their figures were not visible.

In the meantime, Shirone, who had regained her mental stability, turned her steps to the research club.

'First, wait for lunchtime and ask the kids...'

At the moment, Shirone's eyes shone.

'...I have to see.'

The presence of an intruder felt through the sympathetic sense as if passing by.

It was possible to grasp because the sense had just become sensitive after fighting, but it was not very skilled.

'Who are these guys?'

Shirone, who kept pretending not to know and continued to move her steps, turned her direction to a place other than the research club when she saw no sign of the other party appearing.

'They keep following. It's clear that I'm the target. Then...'

Shirone's steps stopped in the middle of the hallway where the warehouses were connected in a straight line.

"Come out."

There was no answer.

"I know everything. If you don't come out, I'll attack."

Shirone, who counted three seconds in her mind, suddenly expanded her spirit zone and grasped the location of the enemies.

However, it seemed that the enemies were the same, and three transparent cloaks were peeled off from the wall like wallpaper, revealing their identities.

"Damn! We've been found out! Run!"

Shirone, who had equipped a powerful photon cannon as much as she was on guard, looked dumbfounded at the ones who were moving away.

They all had familiar faces.

"Are they from the advanced class?"

Even while saying that, the juniors were quickly leaving the hallway, but Shirone regained her composure and released the magic.

Instead, she carefully grasped the symbols on the ceiling, the color of the iron door, and the number of forks, and rolled her head.

"Let's see, the coordinates here are...."

* * *

"Aw, I'm annoyed! Who made a mistake!"

When the girl was annoyed, the two boys who were running side by side with her hit each other.

"You must have been caught!"

"No, it's you. My hide-and-seek ability is with you...."

"Kyaaak!"

When the girl screamed as if she had seen a ghost, the two boys stopped abruptly.

"Huh, how?"

Shirone was already blocking their way.

"How did you catch up so quickly?"

Shirone sighed and approached.

"How to catch up. You guys haven't moved 10 meters in coordinates."

When there was no answer as if they were honey-eaten mute, Shirone asked.

"So, Shuamin, Alt, Gerain. What's going on here?"

They were juniors who had taken the advanced class integrated class with Shirone until recently.

Especially, Shuamin was the child who showed the trick of counting the number of coins with the spirit zone when Shirone crossed the fence of Alpheus Magic School when she was twelve.

She was a little girl younger than Shirone at the time, but now she has become a girl and shrugged her shoulders like a snake.

"What's going on? Of course, I came to find the teaching materials on behalf of the teacher."

Shirone chuckled at the innocent lie.

"Really? Then should I ask the teacher?"

Alt raised his trembling lips.

"Heh, hehe, is the graduation class so free these days? Do you even have to go to the advanced class to check?"

"Yeah, it's okay. I'm a graduation class evaluation rejecter. I have a lot of time."

As the juniors' faces turned into shit-eating expressions, Shirone watched and approached.

"Tell me honestly. Why did you come here?"

Shuamin and his party looked at each other and seemed to have made up their minds, and at the same time they reached out to Shirone.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
