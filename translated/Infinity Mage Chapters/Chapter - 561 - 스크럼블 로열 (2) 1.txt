[561] Scramble Royal (2)

As Maya was putting food on her plate, the men's gaze followed her steadily.

Not only her beautiful appearance, but also the wide range of changes brought about a sense of wonder.

"Really, you've become beautiful. The picture I saw in the red book wasn't a lie."

Amy asked Nate, looking back at him.

"Red book? What's that?"

"Huh? Ahaha! It's nothing."

It was something Amy could never tell.

"But what's going on? Is it because of Shirone?"

Amy thought that was the only reason.

Shirone had gone to heaven, but Maya had never shown her face at school.

She looked lonelier than before, and she wasn't happy that Shirone had also contributed to the current situation.

As if reading her thoughts, Amy sighed and said,

"Let's eat together."

"But……."

Amy had forgiven her, but she wasn't so oblivious to think that this was her last chance.

"It's really okay. We have 15 weeks left, we can't keep going like this, right?"

Nate, who thought Amy's words made sense, shouted as if to relieve Shirone's burden.

"Maya, come over here! Let's eat together!"

Maya, who had been nibbling on her food, put down her utensils and walked towards Shirone's group, but she didn't bring her tray.

"Hello, everyone. It's been a long time."

Maya's smile was still kind, but the atmosphere was completely different from before due to her changed appearance.

"Yeah, it's really been a long time. How have you been?"

Maya just shook her head and said to Amy,

"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. But I thought I should at least say hello once."

"There's no need for formalities between us. Don't do that and come over here. We always used to eat together."

"No, today is the last day. I won't be coming to the cafeteria anymore."

Everyone in the graduating class was paying attention to Maya's words.

"You're not coming? Why?"

"You know, Amy."

Amy's forehead wrinkled slightly.

"That's a bit unreasonable, isn't it? You're an adult too. Saying things like that only puts pressure on us. If there's something bothering you, why don't you confront it and solve it?"

Maya smiled bitterly at Amy's unchanged appearance.

"I envy you, Amy."

"What, what? All of a sudden."

"I'm sorry. But I'm not as strong as you. Yes, even if it burdens you guys, I can't help but be like this. I know too well that I can't bear it."

Maya added in a small voice,

"So please bear with me. I know it's selfish, but I'm determined to graduate this time."

They could feel the resolve she had come here with.

"And Shirone."

"Huh?"

"Honestly, it was really hard. It hurt so much."

"Oh, that......"

"It's okay. I can bear it now. But that doesn't mean I've completely forgotten about you."

There was a buzz in the cafeteria, and in the midst of that noise, someone clenched their fist with anger.

'Still, she's still thinking about Shirone......'

"You can come find me anytime if you change your mind. I'll be waiting."

"Whew."

The sound of a whistle passed by.

"But if that's not the case......"

Maya, who had been hesitating, put strength into her eyes and said,

"I hope we don't run into each other until the graduation exam. You understand my feelings, right?"

Shirone, pushing back her complicated feelings, nodded her head.

"Yeah, I got it."

It was a pity for Maya, but her heart didn't throb as much as when she received Amy's ultimatum.

Then, suddenly, she thought.

Maybe the tears she shed last night weren't just because of Peope.

Maya's eyes were filled with sadness at the reaction she had expected.

'What was I expecting?'

Did she think that if she pushed him like this, Shirone would shed tears and hold her back?

"Anyway, I'm sorry for making you uncomfortable. I'll leave now."

With that, Maya left the cafeteria.

The noisy cafeteria became quiet for a moment.

Maya nodded in her heart.

She thought she had endured it, but seeing Shirone's face, her heart was pounding and her months of determination were about to crumble like a sand castle.

"Well... take care."

Maya, who bid farewell, returned to her seat, handed over the tray she had hardly touched to the kitchen, and left the restaurant.

Among the many gazes chasing her, Amy's gaze was particularly different.

'What? You're the strong one...'

Looking at Shirone chewing bread with a bitter expression, a sigh seeped out from deep within her chest.

* * *

Shirone and her group spent time at the snack bar until class started.

Shirone spilled the beans about what happened at the research club, and Amy, who had heard the ins and outs overnight, had no trouble understanding.

However, she was completely ignorant about the research club in the shadows.

"A hide-and-seek research club? There was such a research club at school?"

Nade answered.

"There are a few more besides that. Most of them don't need to have a presentation like us as long as they have the right number of people."

In fact, the influence of the presentation was great in making the Supernatural Spirit Science Research Club known.

"But why did the juniors follow me? I wonder why they ordered attack magic to the juniors, are they sane?"

Iruki said.

"I guess they think the same as me. As graduation approaches, they start to move slowly. Revealing the secret of Istas."

"But it was quiet last year, wasn't it?"

Nade asked, stroking his chin.

"When you gave up the evaluation, rumors spread at school. There was a time when access to Istas was banned for a while. Including us, the members of the research club."

"Ah..."

It was the time when the National Intelligence Agency was lurking in the school to find Gauld.

"The juniors are incredibly sensitive guys, so the switch is on. There is definitely something in Istas. The hide-and-seek research club was caught today, but there is a high possibility that other research clubs have already approached."

Shirone spread her arms in frustration.

"But who is the president of the hide-and-seek research club? You should know, right?"

"Yeah, I have a rough idea. The hide-and-seek research club is running a black market in the school. I've also made and sold a few inventions. The most likely candidate is..."

"It's me."

When they turned their heads at the sudden voice, Prins, who is currently ranked third in the advanced class, was standing there.

"Is it... you?"

Nade asked with a twisted expression.

A face with long and thin eyelashes up and down and a thin mustache.

He is a typical genius with a very fast thinking speed, but he has never been associated with Shirone's group because of his perverted and ominous personality and greasy tone.

Shirone glared at him with wide eyes.

"Why did you follow me? Besides, you ordered the juniors to use attack magic, are you sane?"

"Hehe, why is this? The star of the graduating class, the juniors just joked around."

It was as greasy a voice as his appearance.

"This is just the beginning. The hide-and-seek research club is hiding everywhere. For example, I know that Amy came to your room yesterday and had a secret meeting."

Shirone's eyebrows twitched.

It wasn't so immature to be spied on, but there was no need to hide the fact that Amy came to the room.

'It's okay. They couldn't have gotten close.'

While Shirone was relieved, Amy was angry at the strange misunderstanding.

"What a secret meeting. How can everything you think of be so low?"

"Hehe, Amy. You still smell good, no perfume can reproduce the smell from your body."

Prins, who sucked in air as if his nostrils were sticking together, trembled his eyelids and his whites were exposed.

'Dirty...'

Voyeurism, a personality that is obsessed with smell to the point of madness, and a greasy tone.

He was a man who made her want to escape from the world rather than live under the same sky.

"Anyway, it's good to expect. 15 weeks until graduation. Most of the research clubs in the shadows are waiting."

"Nade responded with a snort.

"Right. We need to gather as much as we can. We are the elite few."

Prings pointed to Shiro's group with his index finger under his nose.

"A mediocre class one, the last in the graduation class, a group of runaways. It seems there are no elites higher than me?"

"This is real!"

As Nade jumped up, Shiro stopped him by grabbing his arm.

"Hold on. It doesn't matter if we're confident."

Nade, looking at the departing Prings, was shaking his fists.

"I just want to hit that kid so bad. I'm even more angry than I was with Iruki before!"

Iruki ignored the last comment.

"Anyway, the war will start soon. We need to prepare for everything from now on."

Amy raised her hand.

"Wait. Why are we attached to that? I clearly don't want to be involved in your 'stupid something' research club."

"It's supernatural spiritual science."

"I don't care what it is. I'm not doing it. If it's Shiro's precognition problem, I might consider it, but graduation is my top priority."

Shiro brought up the main point.

"Let's summarize for now. How many research clubs are targeting Istas?"

"Hmm, probably all the research clubs in the shadow are targeting it. Among them, the most cautious organization would be Fermi's Golden Wheel."

It was the strongest research club with five skilled graduates from the graduation class, which is the core of the shadow economy.

"Fermi is the president for now, and there's Electric Monster Raikon as his right arm. Hershey of Sona as a staff officer, and Richard of Alchemy as an action captain. And one more is......"

Iruki pointed to the window of the snack bar.

"There he is. Kaiden."

Kaiden of the Cross.

He was a handsome man with a neat, reddish-brown hair.

Even Nade, who knew the positions of the executives because of the famous Golden Wheel, didn't know much about Kaiden.

"Yes, Kaiden makes up the team of five. Now the hierarchy is torn, but until the middle of the first half, they monopolized the first to fifth places."

Shiro asked.

"What is Kaiden's rank now?"

"He is now seventh."

"Wow, he's still in class one."

As Kaiden suddenly turned his head, Nade was startled and bowed his head.

"Ugh! He's looking. Be careful. His senses are very good. If Dorothy is intuition, he is senses."

Kaiden, who seemed uncomfortable, stared at Shiro's group and left his seat. Nade pretended to wipe his sweat.

"Phew, I almost got caught."

Iruki asked.

"Why are you so nervous, unlike you?"

"You should be a little nervous about that guy."

"Ho?"

It was a word that was hard to hear from Nade.

"I don't really know. Kaiden doesn't do much in the Golden Wheel. Honestly, he's a straightforward character, but I don't know why he's hanging out with Fermi."

"In other words, you feel strange."

In Nade's language, it meant dangerous.

"Well, all the members of the Golden Wheel are notable figures. Besides, Fermi made a lot of money this time."

'Right, that's right.'

Shiro recalled the story he heard from Miro.

Fermi earned 190 billion gold by forging a signature in the Under Coder.

Even if it's a split payment, more than 10 billion gold is coming in, so the level of magic he uses must be different from before.

"Okay, I've got the Golden Wheel. And next?"

Nade counted with his index and middle fingers.

"The second strongest force is definitely the Hide and Seek Research Club. They run their own market, and Prings' skills are not inferior to the Golden Wheel. You don't have to mention the Ant Language Research Club of Pisho, and the Doll Collection Research Club is not to be ignored. The president is none other than Anchar."

"Anchar? Was she in the shadow research club?"

Shiro looked back at the woman with brown hair who was drinking coffee and reading a book on the terrace.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
