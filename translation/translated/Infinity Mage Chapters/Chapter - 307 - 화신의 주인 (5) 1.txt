[307] The Master of Fire (5)

Shirone looked back at Ekkashi without wiping his lips, which were dripping with blood.

"What are you? Do you want to stand up to me on behalf of Habari?"

"Master Bosun is the person I respect the most. You'd better shut your mouth."

"Then you have to die too. Bosun is one of the people I hate the most in the world."

Ekkashi, a typical combat mage, did not fall for the provocation. He grabbed a foot-long club from inside his robe and held it out in front of him. He spoke in a cold voice.

"Spear of Magic, Freeze."

When he opened his palm, the club did not fall but spun in place. As if receiving centrifugal force, spikes came out from both sides and turned into a spear longer than his height.

Ekkashi swung the spear with both hands. A cold wind reached Shirone.

He showed off his flashy spear skills and took a finishing pose, aiming his spear. When the blade stopped, ice shards fell with a crack.

Ekkashi's major was freezing. He was a typical combat mage who focused on polishing his magic spear skills.

Especially, Freeze, the magic weapon, was an expensive weapon that any freezing mage would want to have. It had a high-efficiency option of 128 percent magic amplification as a basic, and it could get an additional 146 percent amplification for freezing magic.

In addition, there was a special magic amplification power at the blade of the spear, the freezing point of magic, which had an absurd option of 280 percent amplification.

Therefore, when Ekkashi cast freezing magic on Freeze's blade, he could produce a whopping 554 percent magic amplification rate.

'It's quite a thing for something made by humans.'

Shirone kept an eye on the ice that continued to fall around Freeze's blade.

The ability to freeze the atmosphere was only possible for Shina, the authority of freezing magic. No matter how much he borrowed the power of a magic weapon, Ekkashi's combat power could not be underestimated.

"Blizzard Blade."

Ekkashi closed the distance with teleportation and muttered in a cold tone.

When Freeze cut through space quickly, the air froze along the line where the blade passed. A long ice line like a rope was born with a crack and then broke into pieces and fell.

"It's shameful to use it on an amateur, but......"

Ekkashi stabbed his spear at the shortest distance.

When Shirone cast frenzy, Freeze's blade penetrated frenzy and exploded.

Shirone and Ekkashi backed away at the same time. And they bounced their upper bodies and rushed toward each other.

A close-range battle where one mistake could take away one's life unfolded.

Shirone saw Ekkashi approaching and slammed his photon cannon on the ground. It was powerful enough to shake the ground, but Ekkashi had already risen to the sky.

He lay in midair and swung his spear with one hand holding the end of Freeze's handle.

An ice tube in the shape of a ring was created along the trajectory of the spear. There was a point where blood was stained red.

Shirone's back was cut thinly, and frozen blood tore through his flesh and splashed out.

"Kuuuuu!"

Shirone kicked the ground and got out of Ekkashi's attack range. But he couldn't hold on for long and collapsed.

The horror of Freeze was that it turned even minor wounds into fatal ones. As the pain burned like fire on his back, he felt his consciousness fading away.

Ekkashi held his spear behind him and watched the state of his prey.

"Your movement is decent. But you're still immature. Be satisfied with being the fertilizer for my ultimate legend."

As Shirone tried to retort with burning eyes, something rolled from behind him.

It was Fresh Truffle.

The dessert that came out at his parents' meal. The dessert that hid a lethal dose of poison in the sweetness of chocolate.

Shirone turned his head with a soulless face. Bosun was sneering as he rolled the chocolate with his foot.

"How about it? Do you want to taste it now? It's very delicious."

"...I changed my mind."

Shirone's face twisted like a demon.

"Die, all of you."

Dozens of lasers shot out from Shirone's body.

There was no need for targeting, and flames burst wherever the wall was scratched and passed. The grand hall shook.

The nobles were in a panic.

Those who thought they would only die as a pawn of Bosun realized that this place was not safe when Shirone started a no-questions-asked terror.

"Damn it! What are you doing! Kill that kid quickly!"

Personal bodyguards rushed to Shirone. Dozens of swordsmen drew their swords and charged, and Bosun's men also poured concentrated fire with their own majors.

Shirone cast frenzy while standing crookedly.

As the heart beat in infinite units, a pure form of energy that could not even see the movement of the curtain occupied the space.

The floor where Shirone was standing collapsed into a deep hemispherical shape like a cookie. People were pushed to the wall by the wind pushed by the curtain of light.

But those who were here were also more than ordinary. The first surprise attack failed, but they immediately recovered their ranks and rushed to Shirone again.

Ekkashi, who was at the forefront, led Freeze.

The wind tearing through the spearhead froze like a blizzard and spread behind him. Shirone countered with a photon cannon, but he quickly bypassed the radius and suppressed Shirone's angle in an instant.

'This is the end.'

At the same time as swinging Freeze, a red flash flashed in front of Ekkashi's eyes.

"Kuk!"

A thin laser passed by Ekkashi's nose, bending his upper body.

He slammed his back on the floor without catching his balance and looked at Freeze with a ridiculous eye. The blade was cut off and the cut surface turned into red lava and flowed down.

'Damn it, where is there such magic in the world!'

Light that cuts metal.

How much output do you have to handle to achieve this level?

The photon cannon reinforced with mass was absurdly heavy, and the laser reinforced with energy was eerily sharp.

The guards who watched the situation realized it then. They misjudged the situation from the beginning.

Shirone had assumed everyone here as enemies from the beginning. Then, in this place where the highest nobles gathered, the combat power of allies would be limited. It was a typical pattern of guerrilla warfare.

A guard who thought so far cautiously asked.

"Captain, I think we need to activate the magic control device..."

"What are you asking for, kid! Run away and activate it right now!"

Shirone turned her eyes indifferently even after seeing the guard run out.

There wasn't much time left to fight anyway. Half of his consciousness was already in the underworld. He couldn't tell if his legs were moving or if he was delusional that his limbs had been torn apart.

'I'll kill you all...'

It was only lust and anger.

It seemed that it didn't matter if he died now if he could kill everyone here. If he could soothe his resentment for breaking his spear, he didn't need to think about what would happen next.

"Cough!"

Shirone, who stopped in the center of the grand hall, bent her back and vomited blood.

He reached his limit even with Diamond Body's durability. The process of mental collapse was dirtier than any feeling.

Immortal Function theoretically draws infinite mental power, but human flesh has its limits. This was it.

When Shirone stopped moving, people stopped as if they had promised. Stone debris fell from the ceiling in silence.

"Is it over? Is it over?"

The people who fought with Shirone looked like they were trapped in a room with a ghost. Their eyes were sunken and their faces were sweaty.

"Kill him! What are you doing! Kill him quickly!"

The swordsmen who came to their senses quickly fixed their posture and rushed to Shirone. Dozens of swords flew at all parts of Shirone's twisted body.

Shirone waited quietly for the end. And realizing that the end had come, he muttered quietly.

The sound of the photon cannon echoed in the hall, followed by a deafening silence. Everyone was stunned by the sudden attack, and no one dared to move or speak.

Orkampf felt a surge of anger and fear as he saw his wife fall to the ground, protected by a loyal knight. He didn't know if she was alive or dead, but he knew he had to do something.

He looked at his son, who was still holding the halo above his head, with a mixture of disbelief and horror. How could he do this? How could he betray his own family and his own kingdom?

He wanted to shout, to curse, to reason with him, but he knew it was useless. His son was beyond reach, consumed by hatred and madness.

He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. He had to act fast, before it was too late. He had to stop him, by any means necessary.

He glanced at Boosun, who was kneeling next to him. He saw a flicker of hope in his eyes, as if he had a plan.

He nodded slightly, and Boosun nodded back. They had to work together, for the sake of Kazra.

They waited for an opening, for a moment of distraction. They waited for their chance to strike.

"Si, Siro... "

Eliza trembled with fear, her face pale. She still had the afterimage of the photon cannon on her retina.
