[775] Chain Reaction (1)

As the heat of the explosion disappeared, Miro's party and Shura approached Gaold a little closer.

In the face of the unprecedented situation where the Buddha was broken, their senses were focused not to miss even a small signal.

"I have reached the state of Buddha at the end of experiencing the whole of happiness and unhappiness in the world."

Zulu said.

"But... it wasn't as painful as Gaold."

He understood human suffering, but he didn't understand all the suffering, and the game was divided there.

Saint said.

"Unless Gaold allows it, you can't close this world."

That was why the sermon was broken.

"Yeah. Right now."

At Zulu's supplement, people turned their heads again and listened to the conversation between Gaold and Nane.

"Does it hurt?"

Gaold looked down at Nane and asked.

His whole body had suffered serious fractures, and blood was constantly pouring from his mouth, but his eyes looked peaceful.

"The most in the universe."

Gaold, who burst into a small laugh, sat down next to Nane and took out a cigarette from his arms.

The moment he lit it in his mouth, a cough broke out.

"Cough! Cough!"

A feeling of bones crumbling all over the body came as the aftermath of exceeding the fullness rushed in.

"Are you sucking fire even with such a body?"

Gaold, who stopped coughing, sucked on a cigarette as if it was very delicious.

"Compared to the pain of living, it's just a cigarette. You won't last long."

Gaold looked down.

"Are you scared? I mean death."

It wasn't a question to ask the Buddha, but Gaold wanted to hear it directly because of that.

"Not really. Life and death are no different."

Gaold, who exhaled a long cigarette smoke, said while looking at the wide-open horizon.

"......Just, don't you think about living? Throw away everything like merit, and if you fry and fry, and hang out with people."

Kangnan's eyes were filled with sadness.

'That's right.'

How could Nane be hated?

'In fact, the person who wants to die the most is you. And Nane is......'

He was the one who understood Gaold's feelings the deepest.

"My thoughts do not change. You have suffered infinitely, but you have chosen life......"

A red liquid seeped from Nane's eyes, thinking of the life of a sentient being.

"Not everyone is as strong as you."

Even if the weight of pain is the same, not everyone can endure it with a strong will.

"......That's right."

Gaold, who thought about death as many times as he breathed, could not deny that fact.

"Darn. What's so complicated?"

Gaold threw away his cigarette.

"Why is it so important that others suffer? Then what is your pain? Why do you live so hard?"

Nane was firm.

"Because I know it's right."

Knowing that he could not turn Nane's heart, Gaold kept silent for a long time.

"Really?"

Miro was anxious at the thought that Gaold might leave Nane alive.

'The chain reaction of the law.'

If the Buddha exists, Yahweh also exists, and in the end, good cannot erase evil to the end.

"I'll do it myself."

"Miro."

Zulu said coldly.

"You know, right? We are not qualified."

Only Gaold was more painful than the Buddha.

Therefore, it was only his share to recognize or deny the Buddha.

"The future of mankind is at stake. If you can't finish the game, many people will suffer."

"That's your belief, not Gaold's. He's not a human being. He's a human."

"But......!"

"Miro, admit it."

Zulu looked back with emotionless eyes.

"Humanity has won."

It was Middle Eastern.

The one who broke the Buddha was a human being.

In front of the undeniable fact, Gukseon bit his lips.

'Gaold, listen to my story......'
[Translated block]


"I said, 'Stop it. It's the world you've pierced through, so I'll leave it to humans and leave.'"
Gaold looked up at the sky.
"You're not a bad guy either."
Miro's face turned sad.
'Gaold, please…….'
"But."
At that moment, as if telepathy had passed, Gaold turned his head and looked at Miro.
"It seems difficult for my beloved woman to do something if you live here."
"Huh?"
Those who were listening turned to Miro at the same time, but the more they did, she couldn't even move her gaze.
Nane raised the corner of his mouth.
"That's enough."
Since humans have won, the standard for defining the world should also be extremely human.
"I'm glad your loved one is Gukseon."
Gukseon, the one who must give.
"I don't know about that. I don't want to know."
To Gaold, Miro was just a foolish woman who would even offer her heart for the happiness of mankind.
When Gaold raised his hand, the air sharply parted and condensed into the strength of a sword.
"Goodbye."
As soon as Nane closed his eyes, the air cut through the wind and aimed at his neck.
Kakakakakaka!
Sparks flew in the air as the blade stopped, and a moment later, the illusion of a shield materialized in front of him.
"Haah! Haah!"
Shura, hiding behind the shield, looked down at Nane with a confused expression.
'He's going to die soon.'
It was not a decision made with clear judgment.
'I don't know.'
A moment of doubt that bloomed in my heart when Nane's death hit reality.
She thought she needed time to organize her thoughts, and the motive for action was enough for that.
'Let's get out of here first.'
At the moment when she tried to push Gaold away with the shield of Gestalt, an unbelievable pressure crushed her.
'What is this?'
Despite exhausting her mental strength against Nane, the power of the boundary was not enough for Shura to handle.
"Kiyaaaaaa!"
With the birth of the giant god of slaughter assembled with hundreds of reverse crosses, it was flattened at the same time.
Kuuuuuuung!
A huge explosion occurred due to the frictional force that compressed the solid air directly into the ground.
"Catch Shura!"
Because it was not Gaold's intention, Zulu did not stop Miro, who was now heading to the ground.
A small pit was created in the center of the huge pit in the middle of the sky, and Miro's party entered through the smoke.
"What happened?"
Gaold was standing looking at a distant place.
"I caught it."
And he pointed to the ground and said.
"Half."
Miro looked down.
"Tail cut? It's hard to be honest......"
Shura's lower body, neatly cut off below the waist, was twitching and spilling blood.
Rough breath leaked out between Shura's clenched teeth.
"Heeek! Heeek!"
Only the upper body remained, shaking his shoulders and crawling, but the speed was as fast as the wind.
By the time she passed the cliff of the mountain range in the middle of the sky and went through the complicated tree path, Nane, who was lying on her back, asked.
"Why did you save me?"
"I don't know! I don't know! I'll think about it from now on!"
Nane laughed bashfully.
"You're clumsy at lying sometimes."
That's why I doubt it.
'There's nothing eternal in the world, right? If you die, you die! But... But...!'
Shouldn't you know what it is?
'Lie! Lie! Lie!'
As Shura kicked the ground with both arms and flew her body, blood poured out like a downpour from her waist.
"There is no such thing as truth in this world!"
Everything is just a frequency, and what we believe to be entities are just illusions created by those signals.
"Everything is a lie!"
From being born as a snake and mastering the art of transformation to becoming a human, Shura repeated countless lies.
'But then......'
The ultimate conclusion reached by the god of lies.
'What the hell is real?'
Anyway, there must be something.
"Heung. Heung."

Shura, who had blocked the bloodstains, gritted his teeth and climbed up the steep mountain to reach the summit.

"Haak! Haak!"

She, panting with her chin on the ground and sticking out her tongue about a meter long, turned her head towards her back.

"Are you okay?"

"...I'm not dead yet."

Nane added.

"I would die if you didn't take care of me."

Shura's eyes narrowed.

"Huh! Even Buddha doesn't want to die? So all the words you've said so far are lies?"

"If you look at everything as a lie, everything is a lie, and if you look at it as the truth, everything is the truth."

Nane turned her head.

"In reality, what you and I see is no different."

"......"

Like when dealing with Veron, she couldn't lie in front of Nane's eyes.

"Kkung, wait. We need to hide first......"

Shura, who had put up a barrier of illusion with her Gestalt abilities, bit Nane's collar and crawled into the cave.

Looking at the sky, Nane laughed.

"The weather is nice."

Nane survived.

About three days after hiding in the cave, Shura's lower body had regenerated up to her thighs.

Since she was still uncomfortable walking, Shura filled her mouth with water and crawled out of the cave with both arms.

"Eup. Eup."

As Nane, whose bones had not yet joined, opened her mouth, she passed the water in her mouth to him.

"It's good water."

"Of course. I specially brought spring water. Can't you get up now? You can heal with the Dharma."

"I thought a little."

Shura, who had been licking the dirt-stained body with her tongue, revealed her complexion and turned her head again.

"Did you find out the secret of the world?"

"If I had, I would have already closed the world. Rather, why couldn't I be perfect?"

Shura was disappointed.

"Hey, that's already broken."

"Looking back, it seems to have been wrong from the beginning. Righteousness is not something to reach. It's just right."

Shura blinked her eyes.

"So, whether you go up to falsehood or truth, you couldn't reach the real thing."

The 11th sense, the palace sense.

"Yeah. Whether you call it heaven or not heaven, you don't know unless you become heaven."

Shura imitated Buddha.

"Don't look at the idea, become the idea. That is the true righteousness."

Nane stroked her head.

"Since you know the integration, you can be called a Buddha."

"Hehe, so what are you going to do now?"

"First of all, I have to destroy everything I've built. If you can't reach it, you have to wait for it to be right."

"Hee-hee, it's a pity."

There was only one way to destroy the state of Buddha.

"Now I feel the pain of sentient beings in my heart. Because I can be moved to tears, I don't feel sorry at all."

When the Dharma replication was activated, Nane's bones joined together, and Shura's lower body was regenerated in an instant.

Shura was a little embarrassed.

"I don't like this look......"

Nane comforted her with a smile.

"Let's go. It's my job."

Nane, who went outside the cave, adapted her eyes to the sunlight for a moment, then made a proclamation with a human form.

"I inform the whole universe."

It was Nane's last Dharma.

"Under the current law, we cannot fully save the pain of sentient beings, so we will take special measures."

It was a huge voice.

"Let all beings break their karma."

The fact that the owner of the world gave up maintaining the system echoed throughout the universe.

In other words, it meant that Nane could no longer be the administrator of this world.

'Even though Buddha disappears......'

Shura watched the sword of speech soaring into the sky causing a wave of law.

'We got the possibility to become a true Buddha.'

So maybe.

Even though he had become an ordinary human being who had lost the truth, Nane was looking at the world with warm eyes.
