[732] Two Perspectives (1)

Ivory Tower Artificial City.

The seven stars called by Tae Sung were talking about the world, forgetting about time.

"Yes, we will do so."

Many agendas were processed.

"But......"

From the ancient history to the present, there seemed to be nothing that Tae Sung did not know, and the stars' questions finally approached the essence.

"What does Ra really want?"

Six stars pondered at Tsuoi's question.

"He wants to become a god."

Heukgangshi's words were close to the wrong answer in that they did not resolve the question.

"What is the definition of a god? Creator? Then Ra can't become a god."

Borbore, still lying like a spider, looked up at Mini sitting on his head.

"Because we exist, it means that there is already a creator. God is God, we can't become God."

God is God.

Ghost Goblin Arte fluttered his fan.

"If we can create something, we are no different from God. It's just a public thought. If it's a true god, wouldn't it be something that transcends the public?"

Mong In Luber looked back at Tae Sung.

"I want to hear about it here. What do you think Ra wants?"

"Righteousness."

Tae Sung raised his index finger.

"If God created the universe, God is absolutely right in this universe. Whatever he does, it's right. So if Ra realizes absolute righteousness, he can also be called a god."

"God is absolutely right."

Luber raised his head with a distant look.

"Everyone is right when they dream. Maybe God is a being who dreams a dream that never wakes up."

"That's right. Our nobility is there."

Tae Sung, who stood up for the first time, looked down at the planet shining under the glass floor.

"From the universe to the natural world, from the natural world to the biological world. In the universal class, we are infinitely weak. But a dreaming being."

Tae Sung looked back at the stars waiting for his words with a kind look.

"We can dream of our own universe. Even if this place is God's dream, we have to keep dreaming."

In the solemn atmosphere, Tae Sung, who had been closing his eyes for a while, slowly opened his lips.

"The time for that dream to break is coming."

In the world of non-existence outside the gate of extinction, Nane has come to organize many thoughts.

Ra Enemy's main body still didn't move as if it was dead, and at some point his event was conveyed to his brain.

"Have you organized your thoughts?"

Nane answered to Ra Enemy of the past.

"Already."

"Why are you conflicting then? What is the remaining attachment to you who have realized the public?"

The world that Nane realized was ultimately a series of pains, and what remained at the end of that pain was eternal nothingness.

"Extinction is always right. Just one thing......"

Nane approached Ra Enemy's main body.

"Except that it can't be turned back."

Ra Enemy's suggestion was accepted without a moment's hesitation, but it couldn't be turned back.

"It is absolutely right because it cannot be turned back."

That is also true.

"Relieving the sentient beings groaning in pain. If that is my last mission left......"

Ra Enemy took over.

"Swallow my dream. Become an irreversible right, and save the sentient beings you want."

Originally, there is no existence, so it is empty.

'Why are you suffering?'

Pleasure, pain, unhappiness, happiness, after all, it's just a phantom in a dream that doesn't even leave a substance.

"Wake up."

Nane decided to wake up the minds of sentient beings suffering in the world by becoming a Buddha himself.

"It's your dream now."

As Ra Enemy's main body dissolved into particles of light and seeped into Nane, the car value began to rise endlessly.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

Mahagaruta looked around the universe.

"Someone cutting it off is not wrong. Extinction is always right. Except for the fact that it can't be reversed."

Because it couldn't be reversed, Mahagaruta couldn't choose.

"Now my righteousness will disappear and your righteousness will lead the world. I can only hope that his 'righteousness' is right."

Taesung said.

"If it's wrong......"

The only case where Nane was wrong was,

"What would happen if all life forms form an integrated mental system and reject him with one will?"

Mahagaruta made a difficult expression at the sight of Taesung, who still did not give up hope.

The fact that there is life means that it is selfish, and therefore we can never be one.

"......Find a new star. There must be someone to replace me."

Taesung's eyes became moist.

"I will miss you."

A kind smile hung on the corner of Mahagaruta's mouth, and the last light flashed in his eyes.

"......"

As if it had never existed from the beginning, the stars' heads became complicated as they looked at the place where Buddha disappeared.

'Where did he go?'

To a world of nothingness, or somewhere beyond even that.

Arte asked.

"Taesung, please teach me. What action should the Ivory Tower take?"

"I will look at the ground."

Taesung, who calmed his mind with a deep breath, looked down at the planet under the glass floor with sharp eyes.

'What's happening?'

Gradually, Taesung's body, which was becoming blurry, disappeared like air.

The inhabitants of the 2-star class opened their mouths blankly.

'This is Taesung's ability.'

She could feel all the events happening on this planet as if she were touching her skin.

'Gaia.'

Because she is this planet.

The presence of Irmir was overwhelming.

"Hahaha! It's thrilling!"

Despite the joint attack of Shiroe, Jinsung Sound, Rian, and Kido, the cave wall burst open with a punch that Irmir threw without caring.

'It's a mess. I'm going to die just from the wind pressure.'

Even the ground-breaking spirit of Dinai, who was crushing the ground like a swamp, did not try to escape from Irmir.

"You poor things......!"

Irmir, who pushed his body buried up to his waist as it was, was hit in the face by Rian's fist.

'Yes, this is it.'

Irmir shivered at the spark exploding in his head.

'I feel alive.'

What if you have to live in a world where there is no material heavier than yourself?

What if the most powerful stimulus is just a breeze tickling your skin?

'I thought I was going crazy.'

For Irmir, Rian's fist was a pleasure even in pain.

"Goaaaaaaaa!"

In the melee of monsters hitting each other without any chance of activating Simta, Mun Kyung clenched his teeth.

'Damn it! I can't even get involved.'

His pride was hurt by the fact that even a lowly goblin was contributing to controlling Irmir's behavior.

"More! Pour it on!"

Irmir's fist, which was thrown with all his might, suddenly disappeared and hit his own face.

"......"

The shock was tremendous, but his body also had the durability beyond the limit of life.

"This cheap......"

Irmir turned his body to the sound of the ether wave spreading and approached step by step.

"That's why I have to deal with it first."

This kind of battle was not fun.

"Shiroe, I will tie Irmir's feet. Attack him. If we combine our strength, we have a chance."

Instead of answering, he heard the sound of Shiroe kneeling down.

"Uuuuuu!"

When the sound turned around, Shiroe was shaking both hands with his teeth clenched.
