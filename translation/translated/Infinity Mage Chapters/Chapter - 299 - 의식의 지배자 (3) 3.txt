"Clear up all misunderstandings? I doubt it." Amy muttered bitterly. She felt a surge of resentment towards Shirone, who had saved her life but also treated her like dirt. She wondered what she had done to deserve such contempt from him.

"Hey, don't be so pessimistic. Shirone is not a bad person, he's just...confused." Reyna tried to comfort her. She knew that Shirone had a complicated past and a lot of inner turmoil. She also knew that he cared for Amy more than he let on.

"Confused? About what?" Amy asked, looking up at Reyna with curiosity.

Reyna hesitated. She wanted to tell Amy the truth, but she was afraid of Shirone's reaction. He had made her promise not to reveal his secret to anyone, especially Amy.

"About...his feelings." Reyna said vaguely.

"His feelings? For whom?" Amy pressed on.

Reyna bit her lip. She could see that Amy was hoping for a positive answer, but she also knew that Shirone's feelings were not simple or straightforward.

"For...himself." Reyna said finally.

"Himself?" Amy repeated, puzzled.

Reyna nodded. She decided to change the subject before Amy could ask more questions.

"Anyway, we should get going. We need to find the ruler of this consciousness and defeat him. That's the only way to free Shirone from his nightmare." Reyna said, standing up and dusting off her clothes.

Amy nodded reluctantly. She got up and followed Reyna, but her mind was still full of doubts and questions.

She glanced at Shirone, who was walking ahead of them with a cold expression. He seemed to be lost in his own thoughts, oblivious to her presence.

She wondered what he was thinking about, and if he ever thought about her at all.

Before Reyna finished speaking, Amy shook her head sharply.

Contrary to expectations, she had a bright face. She even looked a bit ecstatic.

"It's okay. Anyway, Shirona saved me. She probably doesn't hate me to the bone. That's enough, right? Haha!"

She said that, but Reyna guessed how big Amy's loss was.

She was desperately holding on, just to save Shirona.

"Let's hang in there a little longer."

Reyna looked back at Armin. He had been running around the deep end of the Antithesis camp, disrupting the enemy, so his clothes were soaked with sweat.

"Is Antithesis gone now?"

"It's not gone. But there's no more manipulated Antithesis. But we can't relax our guard. It's basically a spirit that criticizes Shirona."

They finished their short break in the square and entered the castle following Shirona's guidance. Ignite had been staying there until a while ago, but no more projectiles were visible.

Shirona went down to the basement. And she walked through the maze-like winding road without any hindrance.

When she opened the door of the warehouse, another staircase leading down to the basement came out.

Armin, who picked up a torch on the first floor of the basement, went down side by side with Shirona. And he stopped the party in front of an old wooden door and looked back.

"If you go through this door, you'll see the dream world, the realm of Rem. There are a few things I need to tell you before you go in. You've all dreamed, but different physical laws apply here than in reality. Simply put, it can be called focus."

"Like concentration?"

"Similar. Reality is a succession of concentration and relaxation. If it's an ordinary life, the relaxation interval is overwhelmingly long. But dreams are nothing but concentration. It follows the dramatic composition of a play. You only see what you want to see, and other situations do not exist. Therefore, if you lose focus, you lose yourself. This is called Rilfin."

Armin spread out five fingers.

"Rilfin is divided into five categories. First, floating sensation. Second, meaningless mumbling. Third, repetition of the same section. Fourth, point of view escape. Fifth, realization of anxiety."

Amy seemed to know what it was. She had also experienced them often while dreaming.

"Dreams only mimic gravity, but there is no actual gravity. Keep checking that your feet are on the ground. The moment you feel floating, you'll rise endlessly. And don't spit out words you're not sure about."

"There must be focus in conversation too. Like a play script."

"That's right. Habitual slang is also not allowed. If you lose focus on language, you'll repeat meaningless words."

"Then is repetition of the same section a focus on space?"

"Yes. Don't turn around or run away without thinking. The focus disappears and you repeat the same section. Fourthly, if you focus on the surrounding situation, you lose yourself and fall into the observer's position. Lastly, don't think anxiously."

"It will come true in reality."

Armin nodded at Reyna's words.

Amy, who had been lost in thought, asked.

"What happens if you get caught in Rilfin? For example, if you rise due to floating sensation or can't stop talking due to meaningless mumbling."

"If we don't all get caught at the same time, we can get out of it. If Amy rises, we'll pull her down, and if she mumbles meaninglessly, we might slap her cheek."

Amy puffed up her cheeks as if she had already been slapped.

Reyna asked.

"What if we can't get out?"

"Sooner or later you'll catch a new focus. But that won't be Shirona's focus, it'll be our focus. In the end, it means dreaming a new dream."

"A dream within a dream."

"That's right. That's why Drimo is called a multidimensional world. It doesn't matter if it's your own dream, but this is someone else's world. If you get buried deep, you may never get out of your dream for life."

Everyone who heard Armin's explanation was tense.

"Don't worry. Sirone walks towards the next exit and we just focus on following him. There won't be any problems."

Sirone took a deep breath and grabbed the doorknob.

"Then... I'll open the door."

Armin's approval fell, and the door slowly opened.

The sound of music faintly heard, and then the performance of the court musician hit his chest.

Amy opened her eyes slightly in a familiar scene.

"Where is this...?"

Many couples were dancing in the grand hall. It was the ballroom of Kazra Castle, where they had stayed just a few hours ago.

Armin explained hastily if he had missed something.

"The realm of Rem is a space that changes dynamically. It's like several plays are performed on the same stage. If the background is the grand hall, the exit will be close."

"That's the exit."

Sirone pointed to the other side of the ballroom.

Amy seemed to know why. It was the door she had left the grand hall with Zion. Maybe Sirone went out through that door to find her. And then this happened.

'It was because of me.'

Amy smiled bitterly.

If she hadn't followed Zion, if she had refused his request, would Sirone be in a different situation?

'Huhu, come to think of it, I hate it enough.'

"Amy Yang, you can't lose your mind."

Amy quickly came to her senses. And she repeated deep breaths and kept her eyes clear.

"Yes, I'm ready."

"Then let's go. Sirone, walk straight without bumping into anyone as much as possible."

Sirone moved his steps carefully. He stopped and waited when couples dancing passed by. If he accidentally bypassed it, he could fall into a rilfin.

Amy and Raina only looked at Sirone's back of their heads. On the other hand, Armin walked around leisurely while looking around. It was possible because he had acquired a lucid dream certificate to perform some kind of mission.

'What on earth happened?'

As much as Sirone in reality is waiting for a terrible death, the situation in the realm of Rem was likely to be a nightmare.

So I was nervous.

At any moment, everyone in the ballroom could turn into monsters, or suddenly people could go crazy and slaughter them.

But nothing happened until they crossed half of the ballroom.

The way back was already out of focus, so it was safe to assume that there would be no trouble there.

'It's strange. What kind of nightmare is it?'

Armin found something and lit his eyes.

'Indeed, that's what it was.'

There were men and women dancing in the center of the ballroom. A beautiful woman in a red dress like a rose and a man with a strange appearance.

The man's eyes were completely torn up, his nose was hooked, and his lips were smaller than a chicken's anus. It was a human face, but it was a shape that could not come out in reality.

'He must have hated him enough.'

If only this were the case, it would not be a big deal for third parties. But for Sirone, it must have been a terrible nightmare.

Armin turned his gaze and found someone serving near the long table.

He was wearing clothes of a grassland tribe that did not match the scenery of the castle at all. He wore a red hat, grew a beard nicely, and confidently smoked a pipe even in a non-smoking area.

The only being that was not Sirone's projection, Mongin Luber who came out on dispatch from Drimo.

Luber looked back at Armin and winked with a grin. But Armin looked at him indifferently and turned his head away.

He is not someone to ask how he is doing out of curiosity. Currently, Mongin is not being analyzed by human intelligence. He just admitted that he existed because he actually existed.

When Sirone arrived at the exit, the focus on the way back ended and the music disappeared.

Is there still a ball going on in the grand hall? I was curious, but no one looked back.
