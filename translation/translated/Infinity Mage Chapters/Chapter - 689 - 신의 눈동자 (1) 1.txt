[689] Eyes of God (1)

The event that bubbled up through the wheel of the void was heading towards all possible patterns.

The reaction of infinite patterns to one randomness was the same principle as throwing a huge number of pebbles to fill the sea.

Everything that could happen happened.

Fighting, dancing, torturing, kissing...

Of course, these events are not actually happening.

It could have happened, but more importantly, the randomness of La Enemy was gradually disappearing.

As the pattern of Shirone increases, the number of possibilities that La Enemy can react to decreases relatively.

Some events change into things that have no chance of happening in the first place, and thus the bubbles of the wheel of the void began to go out.

Eventually, everything left in the end when all events disappeared into 'events that could not happen in the first place' is the true movement zero.

It was extremely easy to grab the shoulder of La Enemy who could not react at all.

"Ha, ha."

Shirone glared at La Enemy with a rough breath.

'I caught it. I'll never let it go.'

Even if I die here, I will bite and stretch.

'It was a probability fight.'

As Luphist was lost in thought, La Enemy spoke.

"You finally came, Shirone."

There was no tension even in a desperate situation.

Piri-ri-ri.

Then a black shadow passed by with a whistle.

Only after the blood splattered did La Enemy touch the part where his right arm was cut off.

"Kido."

When Shirone turned his head, Kido, who was holding La Enemy's arm and slightly lifting one foot, was standing crookedly.

"Hehehe, there can be no mistakes for Speed ​​Killer. From now on, I will thoroughly understand your memory...."

"I know, so eat quickly."

Shirone, who was anxious, cut him off, but unexpectedly, La Enemy was watching the situation with a smile.

"Then where."

As he began to chew on La Enemy's arm, it seemed as if time was flowing slowly.

Everyone watched with tense expressions as something went down Kido's throat.

"Hmm...."

Looking up at the sky and waiting for the 'taste of the event' to activate, Kido's eyes were filled with wonder.

"Huh?"

And then, through <Nemesis>, La Enemy's memory was transmitted to everyone.

Shirone's eyes trembled with shock, and La Enemy, who was watching such Shirone, tilted his head slightly.

This is a story.

It is a legend of a certain being born as a product of perfect coincidence.

"No, no way...."

La Enemy's memory begins at a time in the universe that humans cannot experience.

There were beings with life on a certain planet.

The shape, habits, language, and communication methods were completely different from humans, but that was not an important problem for Shirone and his party.

Because he, had nothing at all.

"It's coming out! I can see the head starting to come out! Hang in there a little more!"

A life born with everyone's blessing began a tragic life without being able to give a second of joy to the family.

"No! No!"

The parents wailed at the sight of the newborn baby.

The mutant born baby did not inherit anything from the parents.

To be precise, all the sensory organs that their species perceive the world were broken.

"Why our baby! Why our baby!"

Nevertheless, the parents decided to raise the child.

At that point, Shirone felt a chill.

'He's crazy.'

He was a child who couldn't ask for anything, and it was even impossible to guess what state he was in.

He doesn't know what light is because he doesn't have a visual organ.

-La Enemy is blind.

He can't hear any sound because he doesn't have a hearing organ.

-La Enemy is deaf.

He can't smell, he can't taste, and even his nerves are paralyzed, so he can't even detect the movement of the digestive organs.

"Ah, ah...."

The parents who were holding the baby in their arms were crying.

But the baby didn't know that.

Because he doesn't have a tactile organ.

-La Enemy is numb.

The baby, who was born without any sensory organs, was just breathing.

That's all he could do.

But the parents didn't abandon the baby.

They decided to raise the baby.

'How could this happen?'

Thus, the ego was leading a mediocre life trapped in nothingness without any characteristics.

There might have been some thoughts, but it was a state where even the thought that it was a thought could not be thought.

Time was meaningless, and the second of the photon system was extended to 10,000 years, 100,000 years, and even 100 million years.

"Ugh!"

Kido, who seemed to burst his head just by accepting the memory, screamed.

Venetia was also shedding tears of blood, recalling the memory that killed two brains.

"Kuuh!"

Even Shiro, who was far superior in mental strength than them, was desperately holding on with a distorted face.

It's frustrating.

It's so frustrating that I'm going crazy.

Perhaps at that time, the child's head was full of something of this nature.

100 million years becomes 1 billion years, and then hundreds of billions of years....

In the endless expansion of time, the nature of nothingness began to twist little by little as it could not withstand the emptiness.

"Kyaaaak!"

The parents who came to provide nutrition for the child as usual were horrified at the sight of the child's body twisting like a baguette and ran away.

The skeleton collapsed, and the organs that were not needed from the beginning went through the process of extinction.

He was gradually turning into a random shape, a mere lump of meat that could not find any function.

By the time 40 years had passed by the standards of the photon system, no one was looking for him.

"......"

In silence, the world was just quiet.

There is no aging function because time does not exist.

It was destined to last forever like an unburdened egg containing only the concept of nothingness.

So it was a perfect coincidence.

A signal without motive, intention, or purpose caused a slight ripple in his world.

"......!"

As the skin of the lump of meat tore horizontally, it began to move for the first time in its life.

Question.

It was definitely a question.

A tremendous light poured into the eyes that were born by opening the horizontally torn shell wide.

-In the beginning, there was light.

Then, as a tremendous amount of information rushed in, the world of nothingness was filled with existence.

He called this world the universe.

-I exist.

Anke Ra (Eternal Ra).

As Venetia knelt down, Kido, who felt dizzy, vomited what he had eaten.

'This is exactly....'

Ra Enemy smiled sadly.

"Yes, this is me."

Kido vomited everything, but new memories were being transmitted from the flesh that had already been digested.

The figure of Ra Enemy sitting like a broken doll in the dark space was visible.

'This is real!'

It was Ra that existed somewhere in reality, not an event.

"Where is it? Where are you?"

"......"

"Answer me!"

Even in the pouring memories, Shiro desperately held onto his sanity and shouted.

Ra Enemy lowered his head and retreated.

"I'm going to be a god."

Finally, Kido, who realized the truth of Ra after all the memories were transmitted, shouted while holding his head.

"Shirone! It's dangerous!"

Luphisto frowned and spread the spirit zone.

'Damn it! That was the plan!'

It was a thought to become Anke Ra again with a human body.

If you can't become a god with the concept of the whole, transform into the most individual existence and challenge again.

'In the end, what is Ra Enemy....'

Anke Ra was a total of events that Ra Enemy had been experiencing from the beginning to now to become a perfect human.

1st place. Ra Enemy (19 years old): 98.7 percent.

Shirone, who recalled the figure confirmed by accepting the Ivory Tower test, felt his hair stand on end.

'It was almost reached!'

Venetia was right.

The car number of 98.7 percent built up with the experience of the event.
[Translated block]


The remaining 1.3 percent of the pieces can be filled with vivid memories of the five senses, not events.

Kido twisted the window with a grimace.

'We shouldn't have come here!'

Through Shiro, Shagal, Kido, Meirei, and Venice, La Enemy's car count was heading towards 100 percent.

"Kill! It's over when it's complete!"

A perfect human being is no different from saying that all other humans are wrong.

Therefore, it is not worth existing.

"It was nice to meet you, Shiro."

As La Enemy reached out, the landscape began to turn red as if the air curtain was peeled off.

"Super Ultra Pakji."

As the boundary between reality and unreality disappeared, a huge army revealed itself.

"How many are there?"

Even when calculated in bulk, it was a large army of over 1,000.

Mouths with long necks like ropes and bulging bellies swept the landscape in an instant.

"Kiaak! Kiaak!"

'Rampage!'

When the curtain of light exploded around Shiro, the arms and legs of the mouths flew in all directions.

'La Enemy?'

As he turned his body, a sword as red as blood flew in.

"Kuk!"

"Do not invade our territory!"

A dull voice was translated through the Ultima system.

'What is that?'

It was a giant warrior with horns attached at right angles to both sides of his jaw.

"Lord of Despair, Barshiba."

As the scenery peeled off behind Shiro, Igor revealed himself.

"What happened, what is this army?"

"There are circumstances in this world too. I'll take care of it."

As Igor jumped out with a spear of blue flame, Barshiba swung a great sword and confronted him.

As Shiro watched the chaotic scene mixed with blood, a voice came from behind.

"It's dangerous like this, Hexa."

A creature with gray skin over three meters tall was approaching with a very awkward step from a human perspective.

"Meirei."

There was no other name to call differently.

"Combat doesn't help us. La Enemy is collecting senses at this moment."

"So what? Do we have to die?"

"That could be one way. But Terraphos is a race that defends order. There is something you expect."

"So?"

"There is one way to temporarily lower La Enemy's car count. But the aftermath that will hit your world will be considerable. It's also questionable whether the representative of humanity will approve."

"Who is the representative of humanity?"

"……none."

That's why I didn't reveal it until the end.

"So I decide here. Hexa, you become the representative of humanity. And approve."

"I don't have the qualifications. It's also questionable whether others will admit it."

"It doesn't matter. It's not a human problem. It's the rule of the Terraphos Chief Justice. This method is never used without the approval of the representative of the race. You are qualified. Decide."

Shiro looked back at Asura's field.

Everyone was killing the army of the back world with tremendous power, but the number was increasing more and more.

'It's over like this.'

Shiro, who made a decision, turned his head and said.

"Okay. I'll allow it."

"Approved. Yes, I will activate it."

Meirei, who was muttering as if communicating with someone, spewed a terrifying light from her retina and walked forward.

"I am the Chief Justice of Terraphos."

The hand as long as a spear pointed at the world.

"From now on, I will start judging all humanity."
