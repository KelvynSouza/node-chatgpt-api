"“That's not possible.”

Before Lian could reply, Shiro-ne put a stop to it.

“The judges are strictly us, and we choose the manpower. The one who needs to show their skills is Wig, not Lian. If you don't like this rule, you're welcome to give up the evaluation.”

Wig was speechless because it was a perfectly reasonable argument.

However, his pride wouldn't allow him to end things after even drawing his sword, and he was confident that Lian would react differently than Shiro-ne.

“Even if the wizard thinks so, would the knight of Maha think the same?”

A human who can throw away any efficiency in front of belief, even though being a knight doesn't mean that everything is filled with muscles.

He couldn't have run away after receiving a challenge when he made a name for himself as a new prosecutor.

“Of course I don't think so.”

At Lian's words, a smile rose on Wig's lips.

“But if my lord refuses, I won't do it.”

Wig knew the weight of the knight's oath.

“How about thinking differently? If you back down here, you will tarnish your lord's honor.”

This time, Lian raised the corners of his mouth.

“You... haven't taken the knight's oath yet?”

“That's right.”

“The sword does not judge. If Shiro-ne tells you to cut, you will cut, and if you are told to cut, you will gladly cut. No matter what words shake my emotions, the will of my actions is not mine.”

Wig's sword slowly came down.

“Mr. Wig, you need to understand the situation well. It's my mercenary group after all, and I decide whether to pass or fail. If Mr. Wig really wants to compete with Lian....”

“If you want to compete?”

“Prove why you are an indispensable prosecutor to me. I want to take Mr. Wig with me in any situation, if I think so, I might allow Lian to have a real sword fight.”

“...I understand.”

Wig, who surrendered to logic, bowed his head deeply.

And when he raised his head again, the free and easy smile was gone, and only the cold chill was swirling on his face.

“Then I'll show you my swordsmanship. It's Wig of the Gale.”

If the purpose was to attract the attention of the judges, the initial provocation was successful, and the three people stared at Wig as if to see how great he was.

The twin swordsmanship began.

Wig, who showed his basics, quickly cut around as if he was bored with flashy movements.

Even while running, jumping, and rotating while landing, the trajectory of the sword never broke, but rather sped up.

'Certainly, it's a tremendous mobility.'

Wig was able to operate four schemas, which was a top-notch figure among the swordsmen.

People who can't open the schema can't even know how their body is moving and what posture they are taking while doing a simple vertical cut.

That's why Lian repeats the same action countless times in front of the mirror and corrects the error.

On the other hand, if you can sense the physical changes in four areas at the same time, you can not only posture, but also know which toe is more stressed from 1 to 10.

'Is this enough?'

This is the realm of talent.

Wig began to operate the schema in earnest.

'Mitochondria build.'

The mitochondria build, which aims for overall body activation, has a strong balance.

It is divided into regeneration and acceleration, and it seemed that Wig had chosen acceleration as his movements sped up.

'Fold here.'

'Folding' is an act of folding the schema in half to concentrate control, and when it reaches the human limit of 7 times, it records an amazing efficiency of 128 times.

From this point on, it is the realm of the godless, which cannot be called a human, but there has been no precedent since the great swordsman Kadel reached it for the first time 300 years ago.

Wig's limit was three times, and as soon as he folded the mitochondria schema, a strong wind blew with every single movement.

"Wow."

This time, even Shiro had to be surprised.

With the basics that couldn't be compared with the bandits, the efficiency soared eight times, and even in the state where he received the help of Arman's nerve enhancement, he could see the afterimage.

"I'll finish this."

As the centrifugal force became stronger, Wig's body began to rotate like a whirlwind.

When the physical activation was basic and the muscular system, nervous system, and sensory system were controlled at the same time, a terrifying gust of wind blew.

When he swept the vacant lot in an instant and took the final posture in front of the judges, a creepy breaking sound pierced through six ears like an awl.

"That's it."

Wig, who had gathered his sword, slowly got up and retreated to his original position.

"Lian...."

Shiro waited carefully for the judgment.

It was a great skill even if he was a stranger unlike other candidates, but that's why Lian's opinion was important.

"Nice work. The reputation of the Storm Wig is not empty."

"Thank you."

Wig said, sticking his twin swords behind his back.

"I'd like to hear Mr. Shiro's opinion. Did I pass?"

"...Yes."

He had to tell the truth as much as he emphasized fairness so far.

"Then I'll make a proposal now. If you want to incorporate me into the mercenary group, there is a part that you must definitely go over. It's not a matter of risking your life under a weaker lieutenant than me, even if Shiro is the captain, right?"

Shiro scratched his cheek.

There seemed to be no one as skilled as Wig except Kuan, but he hadn't seen all the candidates' specialties yet.

"Shiro, you don't need to worry."

Lian said.

"If he's the person you need, use him. That's all I care about."

Lian stood up from his seat as if he had expected the answer.

"And there's no swordsman who would follow a weak commander."

Shiro, who felt Lian's will, nodded and said.

"Okay. I allow a real sword fight. It may be presumptuous, but please make sure there are no hitches in the mission. I believe you will adjust well because you are a professional."

Wig obediently agreed, but he had a different thought inside.

'Because I'm a professional, I can't give in.'

He had no intention of doing it properly, as he applied to the Shiro Mercenary Group to raise his reputation.

"There's not much time."

Lian slowly pulled up the big sword and entered the vacant lot.

"I'll just deal with it for about 5 minutes."

'He's completely ignoring me. He's selling his friend.'

The time when the Storm Wig and the Knight of Macha made their names as newcomers was the same.

Nevertheless, the reason why Lian could evaluate him was because he was a knight of Shiro, a candidate for the Ivory Tower.

'But do you know? From now on, your good lord can't protect you.'

The twin swords came out with a water sound, and Lian aimed the big sword with one hand.

"Come in."

At first, I could see that the full power was great, but I couldn't find any noticeable advantages.

'Is there a gap?'

Wig, who had come up here with innate talent, was more aggressive than cautious, and immediately activated the schema and jumped out.

"Taha!"

It was a sophistication different from the swordsmanship demonstration, and Lian also twisted his body with a surprised expression.

'What?'

He was prepared for a counterattack, but the initial reaction was also a bit clumsy.

'Can't it be... Is it really a bluff?'

He immediately went into the test and the stormy swordsmanship was mercilessly inflicted on Lian.

He was blocking or avoiding somehow, but the clumsiness was quickly grasped.

'It's ridiculous.'

That clumsiness surprised Wig.

'Doesn't it seem like he can't use the schema?'

The schema is important in that it can precisely control the body.

Even if you swing a sword once, many senses such as weight center, posture adjustment, muscle distribution, etc. must be accompanied at the same time, but when observing Lian's actions, it seemed that he was just following his instincts.

'Is this the Knight of Macha? Can you see me?'

The twin swords came out with a water sound, and Lian aimed the big sword with one hand.

From the next chapter of the schema, the efficiency had to drop by half, but even so, Lian's swordsmanship was like a beginner to him who operates four schemas.

'Every time you swing, the trajectory changes. You don't even know how you're cutting.'

A clumsy match always leaves a bitter aftertaste.

Feeling a slight irritation, Wig attacked Lian to end it.

"It's 5 minutes."

At Lian's words, a snort came out involuntarily.

'You're talking nonsense.'

It was enough time to reveal that the knight of Maha was a mess.

"Ta-ha-a-a-a!"

At the moment Wig charged with a stance holding twin swords horizontally, Lian's body rotated at a speed that was dimensionally different from the previous reactions.

Perfect.

It was a word that flashed through Wig's mind, and suddenly a bad feeling arose in the too urgent time to be defined in words.

'Only the current technique is perfect.'

Acquisition.

It is engraved on the body after countless repetitions.

If most adults have 'acquired' the act of walking, the current action was also possible because it was practiced as many times as walking.

'First block...!'

He thought he had to.

And that was Wig's only mistake, and there was no more chance.

The consciousness flew away the moment the wide surface of the great sword hit the twin swords.

What he realized at the end of fainting was the speed of the sword that could not be explained by the schema, and the fact that he would die if he flew like this.

'This is Maha....'

Even when the body shot like an arrow hit the wall of the building, the scream did not sound, and Wig fell down under the wall that was split like a spider web.

"Wig, sir!"

When Shirone jumped out and checked Wig's condition, fortunately, there was no problem with his breathing.

Lian, who had gathered the great sword, said.

"He pulled his neck before he fainted. If the shock was a little late, he would have died."

The back of his head must have been smashed.

"I'm sorry. I couldn't help it."

"No, it's fortunate that it's this much. Honestly, I wanted to sort out the hierarchy properly before leaving."

Lian, who returned to his seat without any injuries and knocked out with one blow, was not feeling good.

'I just won.'

He tried to calm his mind by saying that just winning was everything, but after fighting with someone like Wig who put his skills forward, he had a bitter aftertaste.

"Shirone, let's continue."

Wig was carried out by the guild members and the evaluation continued.

On the Silver Ring side, Kohn received a pass judgment, and one more person from the War Chariot and one more person from the Blood Rose side passed.

As an archer, survival and trap expert, spearman, and recovery wizard were added, the mercenary group began to have some dignity.

Kuan, number 199, dropped Aria under the chair as if there was no need to draw a sword, and finally the last applicant of the last second evaluation, Meirei, entered.

There were many things I was curious about from the beginning, so Shirone put aside the evaluation for a while and asked.

"Can you hear Ra's voice?"

"Yes."

"Can you hear it now?"

Meirei blocked her ears with both hands and raised her head towards the sky without answering.

"......Yes, I can hear it."

I didn't know why Ra's voice was floating as an electrical signal, but I was curious about what he was saying right now.

"Ra's voice doesn't always sound good. It's mixed with a lot of noise."

"What kind of noise is it?"

"Screams."

Meirei narrowed her eyebrows and analyzed the sound.

"Cries of pain, roars of anger. He always...."

She twitched her eyebrows and stopped talking.

"Why is that?"

"Just a moment. He's talking."

Meirei, who slowly lifted her eyelids, conveyed what she heard.

"Carte Moo Ciel, Cartician Be Rebecca Pubble."

Aria tilted her head.

"I don't know. It's the first time I've heard it."

"It's an ancient language. Very old. The meaning is......"

If you want to find me, find the hell inside you.
