[688] Incident Occurrence (3)

Having confirmed Shagal's direction, Lufist cast a fly spell and found Shirone's party.

He didn't even worry when he picked the raw flower, but he knew it wasn't a guy who would die easily.

"The dragon also survived."

As Lufist, who landed on the ground, spoke, Shirone stuck out her lips with a sullen expression.

However, understanding Lufist's feelings of losing Jane, he didn't say anything special about the raw flower.

"Meirei is strange."

She didn't feel humanity from her face.

"Is it a teraphos?"

Because it was a position to receive the secrets of the world, he was not surprised to see an intelligent life form from outer space.

However, they had to know the intention that appeared through Meirei.

"What are you aiming for?"

Meirei seemed to collect sounds and looked around, then answered in human language.

"Order."

"Order? What order?"

The answer did not come back, and for now, the mission was a priority, so Lufist folded his thoughts and said.

"Okay, let's go from now on. Shagal has taken action. La Enemy is nearby."

Kido reached out his hand.

"Give me too, Nemesis."

When Lufist turned around, Shirone briefly explained.

"It's taste."

Since he now guessed the intention of La Enemy, Lufist obediently handed over the spare Nemesis.

"Hmm, if you drink this......"

When Kido put the ring on his index finger, the imagined reality was implemented and the situation of the goblin tribe unfolded.

'Sister.'

Kido's sister, wearing a ragged skirt, was tearing a pig's leg with one leg on a rock.

The hearty and wild impression was unpleasant to humans, but Kido looked at it with a bright smile.

"Hehe."

Lufist spoke coldly.

"Block your thoughts. Interference is fatal in battle."

The scenery disappeared in an instant.

The fact that he could immediately control his mind showed Kido's realm.

"Let's go. Chase Shagal."

The magicians flew in the sky and Kido chased them quickly from a distance.

After running for 3 minutes, Shagal, who was stabbing a rapid sword in a state of losing reason, appeared.

"Uaaaa!"

He looked crazy, but his genius movement made him feel the presence of a virtual La Enemy.

"Enter the radius of Nemesis."

When they entered within 20 meters of Shagal, Shirone opened her eyes wide at the sensation she felt for the first time in her life.

'This is the scent of the incident.'

Like recalling the past from a specific smell, the scent of La Enemy that Shagal was smelling was strongly conveyed.

'But I don't know where it is.'

The detection ability of the sense of smell, unlike the sight, was not subject to concealment and cover, but could not catch the exact point.

-I am here, Shirone.

When the frequency of God resonated, everyone turned their heads to the left when they heard the voice of La Enemy.

"La Enemy!"

Shirone shouted towards nowhere, but the answer came from a completely different place.

-What is the universe?

"Come out! Show yourself in front of me!"

-Why can't I be a god?

"Kiee!"

Kido slid past the point where the voice was heard as if sliding on his back and swung his spear, but there was nothing to catch.

Shirone immediately turned her gaze.

'It's useless. He only exists in the past.'

If the voice coming from the past, there was no guarantee that he would still be there.

'But it's not a distant past.'

Because Shagal was still here, and if it was a past within 1 second, he could attack La Enemy with a time bomb.

'Frenzy!'

When he cast a spell using the time bomb, a curtain of light dominated the entire 20-meter radius.

At the same time, Shagal sniffed his nose and left the place.

'He avoided it. The magic definitely works.'

The fact that Shagal's movement was instantaneous meant that La Enemy was staying close to the present.

"Let's go. Chase Shagal."

The magicians flew in the sky and Kido chased them quickly from a distance.

After running for 3 minutes, Shagal, who was stabbing a rapid sword in a state of losing reason, appeared.

"Uaaaa!"

"Where are you! Come out!"

Then someone touched Shirone's shoulder.

-Answer the remaining question, Shirone.

Shirone felt his heart sink at the cold voice heard nearby.

'He's behind me.'

Everyone felt it through Nemesis, and Kido threw his body, but the first to arrive was Shagal.

"Die!"

"Ugh!"

Shirone hastily twisted his body to avoid the dagger.

"Get a hold of yourself! If we don't combine our powers......!"

"I'll kill him! I'll definitely kill him!"

As Shagal, who had lost his reason, kicked the ground and sprinted down the road, Luphist, who had risen into the sky, shouted.

"Follow him! It's over there!"

As the chase began again, Kido stuck close to Shirone's side.

"Wait until the time is added. He's a guy who manipulates cosmic-level events. He can probably calculate the movement of air molecules. You have to assume he's the strongest enemy."

"Does it matter if he materializes?"

Kido nodded his head.

"It's not enough to find him. If I can't suppress him, I can't eat him, and then I can't figure out La Enemy's intentions."

Luphist lowered his flight altitude and said.

"I don't know how many chances there will be, but think of it as one. When the opportunity comes, never miss it."

Shirone gritted his teeth and nodded.

"Yes."

He would never miss it.

Lian and Kuan, Venice joined Etela and rushed to Radum's hidden facility area.

'It's a really strange feeling.'

There's no such thing as a destination.

Because wherever they go, La Enemy will be there, so it's okay to empty their heads.

'So it's ominous.'

Kuan looked back at Venice.

'Why did La Enemy kill her brain?'

Probably because Venice's free will was a hindrance to La Enemy's design.

'If so, we conclude that we should not meet La Enemy......'

"There's no need to think."

Kuan looked at Etela.

"Whether it's La Enemy's intention or our will, we can't distinguish it. We should consider that we've already been eaten by the event."

It was the loss of free will.

"So there's only a frontal attack."

The only thing they could do was to meet La Enemy and annihilate his existence.

Having made a decision, Kuan stopped and put the Nemesis ring on Venice.

Feeling Etela's gaze, he explained.

"It's what Aria was wearing. Now if La Enemy approaches, you can confirm it with your eyes."

Then Shirone's voice was heard.

"Lian!"

Shagal, with his eyes full of madness, was charging, and Shirone and his party were following him.

"Ah, ahhhh......"

When Venice trembled and moaned, Lian, Kuan, and Etela turned their heads at the same time.

A handsome man with a Middle Eastern outfit and long hair like a woman was standing there.

"Finally."

The senses were integrated.

"La......!"

Shagal spat out saliva between his teeth and threw a bag full of machine guns with all his might.

"Enemyyyyyy!"

La Enemy, who turned around, smiled beautifully, but the smile was not for Shagal, but for Shirone.

"It's been a long time, Shirone."

It was a wait of billions of years for La, but only 20 years for Shirone.

"Why! Why! Why!"

Shagal was at the forefront.

Dozens of machine guns flew towards all of La's vital points.

A technique that took the lives of many strong men.

However, La Enemy avoided all attacks with a beautiful movement as if dancing.

"What......!"

It was such a strange event that even the will to continue attacking was extinguished in the desperate Shagal.

'This is impossible!'

The intuition of a genius was saying so.

"Shirone! Now is the time!"

As soon as Luphyst shouted, Shirone stopped.

'I won't miss!'

Quantum Superposition-300 Overlap-Fire God Technique-Angel's Punishment.

The incarnation of the Archangel bloomed greatly and began a tremendous bombardment towards La Enemy.

It was a power that could kill everyone here, but even so, the sacrifice was inevitable.

'If we can remove La!'

Since everyone had the same thought, there was no one who resented Shirone, who cast magic unknowingly.

The earth-shattering roar pierced the eardrums.

The fragments fell first, and the dust cloud spread out, eroding the city like a giant monster.

"Phew! It's amazing."

Lian walked out, pushing a brick larger than a person upwards.

The spear of light that Shirone stabbed without mercy was much more powerful than what she had seen in the graduation exam just a while ago.

'If I survived, everyone would have survived.'

Those gathered here were the best elites.

The first thing that caught my eye was a pitch-black hole that was so deep that its depth could not be known, spanning tens of meters in radius.

And above that hole, La Enemy was floating.

"...It's fine?"

The other people who revealed their figures one after another through the smoke could not understand the current situation.

Only Shirone could definitely review the moment when 300 spears were sequentially stabbed.

"This is... impossible."

The emotion that Shirone felt was exactly the same as what Shagal felt a while ago.

'There was no way to avoid it!'

It was not because Shirone was overconfident in her skills, or because she underestimated La Enemy's abilities.

Movement Zero.

Despite the fact that 300 spears perfectly blocked La Enemy's path, it was avoided.

'Was there a route to avoid?'

Shirone shook her head roughly.

'No, there's absolutely none. Even if I were in that position, there would be no way out.'

It is impossible to find a way to break through in a situation where you are perfectly checkmated.

Because it's not difficult, it's actually not there.

Mairei approached Shirone.

"Hexa. It's a perfect random number."

"Perfect... random number?"

"Humans can't create randomness. Even if you try to set something randomly, the intention of 'I will set it randomly.' itself creates a new pattern."

Can we imagine perfect randomness?

"But La is different. That's perfect chaos. Because it moves outside the pattern, you end up believing it doesn't exist."

Raise your hand, blink your eyes, shout.

La can perform some action that transcends the category of nearly infinite actions that humans can do.

"Just because you can't imagine it doesn't mean it doesn't exist."

"Yeah. If Hexa is a 100% inevitable product, La is a 100% accidental product."

If everything is triggered by chance beyond the pattern, it is natural that humans cannot imagine it.

"So in other words, it's annoyingly strong. What are you going to do now? It seems like a one-sided firepower is ineffective?"

Mairei said.

"There is a way to remove La Enemy. But that's also possible if you steal his blueprint."

Kido, staring at La Enemy, pushed his glasses.

"If you eat him, you can eat his imagination too. After all, perfect chaos doesn't mean invincibility. So... you know? Chaos is like that? It's weak and strong......"

"Yeah, I got it."

Shirone said as she moved.

"I'll create an opportunity. Then you eat La Enemy."

"How are you going to do it?"

"...I don't know."

As Shirone, who ran with a smile, jumped over the pit with teleportation, La Enemy spread his arms and greeted him.

"Can you do it, Shirone?"

I don't know.

But there was an answer there.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
