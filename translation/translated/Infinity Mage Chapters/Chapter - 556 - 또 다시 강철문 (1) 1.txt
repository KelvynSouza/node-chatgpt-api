[556] Once Again, Steel Door (1)

Although they are the incarnations of the same Prajna, the depths they contain are completely different, so just facing each other, Shiro felt pressured.

There's no way that Shiro, who has just reached the border, and Miro, who has surpassed the mystery, can be the same.

"Don't be nervous. You won't die."

The fact that anything is possible except death made her even more nervous.

'Sibulsangpokmae....'

Whether Miro knew her feelings or not, he glanced up at the stern face of the Archangel.

No incarnation can manifest anything beyond itself.

'Intimacy of light, particles of God, Ataraxia, Valhalla Action....'

Many experiences and techniques must make up the Archangel, but Miro couldn't help but think of the influence of someone who doesn't exist now.

'McClain Gopin.'

If Miro breaks down 1 second to the limit, Shiro destroys the boundary of 1 second.

The incarnation technique where the characteristics of light, particles, and waves are concentrated.

'If you reach the realm of Barabmil....'

She couldn't imagine what the result of Sibulsangpokmae would be.

"Let's start."

As Miro slowly twisted his body and took an offensive stance, Shiro also stepped back and prepared to accept it.

As the stance of the incarnation changed accordingly, the tension rose to the limit.

'Cheonsugwaneum Naknoejang.'

Before Miro's expression or posture changed, the incarnation moved.

In the space of 1 second divided into thousands of pieces, the continuous attack of Cheonsugwaneum overlapped a thousand times and struck Shiro's head.

'Uwaaaa....'

Shiro, who was able to see the attack of Gwaneum for the first time, trembled as if she was electrocuted.

Can a human mind fall so deep?

'I have to avoid it!'

The Archangel infiltrates the body, and Shiro quickly twists her body.

'I hit it!'

At the same time as Miro widened his eyes with certainty, a thousand barriers were nailed to the floor.

And Shiro, following the gap of time that Miro could not perceive, had already moved to the right.

"Huff! Huff!"

Although he controlled his strength, it was sincere, so Miro, who was breathing heavily at Shiro, gave her a smile of passing.

"You passed. Congratulations, Shiro. This is the end of the training."

As soon as the word "end" was plugged into her brain like a switch, Shiro's eyes gradually rolled up.

"Ah, thank you...."

She couldn't stand any longer due to the shock of the long ordeal and the recent attack of Gwaneum.

With a thud, Shiro, who fell flat, couldn't get up, and Miro, who seemed to have relieved one worry, carried her back to the hut, exhaling.

It was around 4 in the morning.

* * *

"Uhm."

Shiro opened her eyes, trying to regain her hazy mind as if she was drugged.

'Training!'

Her body was tense first due to the repeated daily training, but as soon as she remembered Miro's words at the end of her memory, her muscles relaxed immediately.

"That's right, it's over."

Her body felt heavier than usual.

It must have been her original weight that she hadn't felt until now.

"I did it, really...."

Shiro raised her arm and clenched her fist tightly.

She had completed the training that seemed impossible and obtained a powerful incarnation technique.

But the biggest achievement she gained from this training was the experience of overcoming herself countless times.

'This experience will bring another success.'

That's how you go on endlessly day by day.

"Where's Miro?"

Shiro, who had fully recovered her body, slowly went to the kitchen.

Miro was nowhere to be seen, and only the porridge boiled in the morning was left.

"......"

She realized for the first time that the taste was not adaptable.

It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a divine realm to create a new bitter taste every time it was boiled.

"I'm not hungry yet."

She denied reality by talking to herself, and Shiro went out to find Miro.

When she opened the door of the training hall in the sunlight at noon, Miro was immersed in meditation, lighting only a few candles.

"Did you wake up?"

"Ah, yes."

I was worried that he might ask if he had eaten something deadly, but fortunately, Miro just offered him a seat.

"Sit down."

As she turned the chair and waited, her eyelids slowly opened.

"You did it, Shiro."

"Yes. Thanks to Miro. Thank you."

"You worked hard. There's not much left of the vacation. Let's go down the mountain tomorrow."

Thinking about meeting her family, Shiro's heart was full.

"But as you know, nothing has changed. You will face many trials in the future. In the life of human Shiro, and in the life of a wizard."

Shiro recalled what Miro had said before entering training.

"I'm prepared."

"Right. I promised to tell you when the training was over. As a senior at the magic school, as a victim who received the world's attention before you, I'll tell you what you should do at school."

As Shiro took a deep breath and waited for the words, Miro raised her index finger and explained the strategy.

"First, when you go back to school..."

* * *

West family in the central region of Torumia.

Nade, who had spent the entire vacation in the warehouse, fell asleep with a fluttering heart with the opening of the school right in front of him.

I can meet my friends.

Although it was unclear whether Shiro was alive or dead, it felt like flying just by the fact that he could leave the house.

But maybe because happiness didn't suit him, the old days came back to life as a nightmare that night.

"Hahaha! This guy is interesting!"

"Ahhhh!"

The notorious bandits who cut their heads like chicken beaks tied Nade tightly and applied electric shocks.

"Do it! Do it again!"

"Please save me! Please save me!"

The electric shock suffered at a young age was not only painful but also a fear that the brain could not accept.

"Is this magic?"

"What kind of wizard is a kid? Kid, did you really make this?"

"Ahhhh!"

As another electric shock was applied, Nade, who was dreaming, shook his body roughly.

He was soaked in cold sweat, and his hands were clutching his chest as if in pain.

"Don't... don't..."

As a blue electric current emanated from Nade's body, the metal parts scattered in the warehouse began to tremble and then floated in the air.

"Die! Die!"

The bandits tormented Nade persistently.

'Mom, mom... why?'

Blood flowed from the burns engraved all over his body.

His body felt like it was on fire, but he resented the world in the unbearable pain.

They will kill him.

What was most sad was the fact that no one would come to save him.

Because the people who ran away leaving him behind would never come back.

"Good! This time it's maximum output!"

Nade could only watch as the pincers of the generator he made were attached to his body.

The switch went all the way up, and an unbearable current flowed through the child's body.

"Ahhhhhh!"

Nade, who woke up from his dream, screamed and sat up abruptly.

At the same time, a strong electric current spread all around, and the warehouse exploded with a bang.

"Huh! Huh!"

Sitting on a burning bed, Nade stared straight ahead with desperate eyes.

Then, realizing the situation in a hurry, he threw off his burning clothes.

"Cough!"

Even after 10 years, there were still scars from burns here and there on his body.

The only people who knew that it wasn't an accident while experimenting were his family and Iruki.

"What! What happened!"

People who heard the explosion from the mansion rushed in and looked at Nade with a dumbfounded expression.

It was the reason why he had not been going into the mansion for some time.

It was familiar to be looked at with fearful eyes by people, but there was one gaze that could never be familiar.

His mother was standing among the crowd.

As terrifyingly distorted as her expression was, Nade thought his own expression would be distorted.

The opening day of Alpheus Magic School has returned.

After a day of venting with his family, Sirona slowly set off for school in the carriage of the Ogent family.

The graduation class could afford time as they passed the steel door separately from the entrance ceremony, and Sirona had deviated from the test.

From the time the advanced class was noisy and disbanded, the graduating students began to pass the steel door one by one.

The head teacher of the graduation class, Colly, who had been guarding for a long time, greeted them with a smile, meaning to welcome them to hell.

Amy, Canis and Arin, Iruki, Nade, Dante and others, the pupils of the students climbing up the hill were all creepy.

'Huhu, this is why I'm in the graduation class.'

Anyone who has digested the first half of the graduation class schedule realizes that the fierceness of the competition surpasses imagination.

It leads directly to special training, and when the opening day comes again, it emits a sharp energy like a well-tempered sword.

'No one was discouraged. Everyone did their best. But only 10 of them can graduate.'

Even he himself was creepy, how much would the parties feel sick?

So it was a quiet atmosphere despite the long-awaited reunion.

Iruki and Nade were venting to Amy, but it wasn't as lively as before.

'Sirona is not there. I was looking forward to the revenge match.'

Canis, who had finished the terrifying special training during the vacation and came, was very sorry for that.

"Long time no see, Amy."

When Canis raised his hand, Amy also greeted him calmly.

"Yeah, it's been a long time. Did Arin do well?"

While Arin shyly waved her hand, Canis looked around pretending not to know.

"So where is Sirona?"

"Sirona? Why are you asking me that?"

At Amy's annoyed voice, Canis blinked for a moment and then laughed as if he understood.

"Don't misunderstand. I just asked because you're close. I never think I've been jilted."

Fire was lit in Amy's eyes.

"What nonsense are you talking about? What does it matter where Sirona is or not!"

"I got it, I got it."

Canis, who usually boasts of being Amy's enemy, thought that he should not touch this time.

But the atmosphere was already a funeral.

'Bad kid. How can you leave like that? I don't care anymore. Whether you die or not.'

When Amy left the place with a twisted face, Iruki and Nade looked at each other.

"What happened? Iruki, didn't you hear anything from your father?"

"Not at all. I hardly talked because I was training. Even if I ask, he won't tell me."

"So... Is he not going to come back to school? No, before that, is he alive?"

Fermi crossed between the two and said.

"He's not a guy who dies easily."

"What, that kid? Just like you know."

Nade grumbled at Fermi's back, but Iruki just kept silent.

"27 people. It seems like everyone is gathered."

As Colly said, Aider was still in the hospital, and Maya and Sirona refused the evaluation, so they didn't need to attend.

"Now, the start of a new competition from today. I will introduce the second half schedule, so follow me."

The students were about to move following Colly, but Screamer, who was looking back, pointed towards the steel door.

"Huh? There's one more person coming over there?"

"Huh? That, that is......"

The pupils of the graduating students trembled in shock.

A blond boy who didn't even carry a bag with his luggage in a cubic was walking up the hill leisurely.

"Sirona?"

When Nade said, Amy's heart started to beat thumpingly, realizing that it was reality.

"Hello? Long time no see."

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
