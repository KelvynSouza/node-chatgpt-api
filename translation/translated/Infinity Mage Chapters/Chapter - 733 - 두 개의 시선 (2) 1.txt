[733] Two Perspectives (2)

* * *

When Amy opened the window, the spring breeze was mixed with the winter chill, and she smiled brightly.

'The flowers will bloom now.'

She had been devoted to training day and night to pass the public exam, but she was excited today.

'Should I go to the city for a while?'

She chose pretty clothes and put on makeup in front of the mirror, not thinking of showing it to anyone.

"Hmm......"

She was looking at her beautiful face and puffed her cheeks, making a cute gesture when the door opened.

"Amy, you should eat breakfast."

Seeing her daughter's cute side that she couldn't usually see, Amy's mother, Isis, sighed.

"What are you doing alone?"

"......Well, that's......"

Amy, who straightened her posture as if nothing had happened, continued her makeup and spoke.

"I'm going to have breakfast outside. I'm going to get some fresh air."

Even after the graduation exam, Amy's passion did not diminish at all, but it was only for magic.

"Don't do that and meet some men outside. You've been zoning out a lot lately. You're even doing strange things now."

"Strange things? Is that something you say to your daughter?"

"I'm worried."

Isis, who had been scrutinizing Amy, spoke cautiously.

"Well, a friend of mine has a son, and he asked me to introduce you... He seemed to like you."

Amy burst into an absurd laugh.

"What are you talking about, mom? You used to cut it off sharply."

"That was when you were a student, and now......"

"You know I'm seeing someone. How are you going to face him later?"

That was the problem.

"But Shiro doesn't even contact you... And he's too......"

Isis, who had learned about the Ivory Tower after hearing that she was officially dating Shiro, was worried.

'He said it's dangerous. It's better to give up on the family.'

It was a jealous advice to Isis, who had a relationship with the kingdom's top magician, but it wasn't wrong.

'What's the use of all the power if you don't come home?'

Unable to withstand Isis's worried gaze, Amy puffed up her waist and got angry.

"What are you thinking? I haven't even taken the public exam yet and I haven't got a job!"

Amy was just twenty years old, but it didn't seem like a normal relationship, which was the problem.

'Won't she really be able to get married?'

Isis sighed and left the room.

"Anyway, be careful. And try to change your mood."

"Anyway, worrying......"

Amy, who snorted and saw off her mother, started eye makeup again in front of the mirror.

'Shiro.'

She was about to have complicated thoughts, but she quickly shook her head and erased her thoughts.

"He's doing well, right?"

It was Ariane Shiro.

* * *

Labyrinth Andre - World No. 9999.

In the heyday of the Immortality Project, Utopia, Shiro received two choices from Argo.

'Emptiness and infinity.'

If you choose emptiness, you can live forever, and if you choose infinity, he would have disappeared at this moment.

-It's good to live forever.

Argo suggested.

-There are so many benefits to being eternal. On the other hand, humans experience information discontinuity every time. The fear is serious. This way, you can solve everything.

How many people would refuse in a situation where they suggest immortality in front of death?

Shiro didn't want to die.

'But......'

He couldn't accept Argo's suggestion.

"Can the universe be bigger than a mother's love for her child, no matter how vast it is?"

-Well, shall we analyze it?

"I won't choose immortality."

Because there was no Amy.

"Can the value of living forever be better than the fleeting moment with the person you love?"

Argo's drone trembled, and Amy's hologram revealed itself again.

"...The concentration of emotions is tremendous."

Amy's hologram grew endlessly and finally soared to the ceiling of the center.

"That's why."

Shirone spread her arms and shed tears.

"No matter how big the universe is..."

As the spirit of the Immortal Function spread into the infinite realm, the body emitted a pale flash.

* * *

"Let's go!"

The superhuman battle between Lian and Imer was now approaching its final destination.

The body, which was as solid as a steel wall, finally caused a crack by a fist that was just as solid.

"Hahaha! Good! More! Come in more roughly!"

Imer's fist caused a storm, relentlessly breaking down Andre's wall.

Kururururung!

"Dangerous!"

A large rock fell on the spot where Shirone was crouching as the ceiling of the cave collapsed.

"This...!"

He pushed out the lightning by distorting space with ether waves, but it was only a stopgap measure.

"Get up quickly! It's dangerous!"

"Huuuuu...!"

Shirone couldn't even hear the voice of the sacred sound.

'It's coming! It keeps coming...!'

Without even knowing what concept it was, his head was filling up with a unique realization.

Insight is a bridge that leads from ignorance to intellect, but now it was 19,000 insights.

It felt like he would reach one truth no matter which direction he reached out, and it rushed in like a wave even if he didn't want to accept it.

"Run away. I can't anymore..."

The sacred sound gritted his teeth and made a grinding sound.

'What on earth is happening?'

To others, it was just a pale face, but in the eyes of the sacred sound, a flash that seemed to blow up the world briefly passed.

"Princess! You need to avoid it quickly!"

The battle between Imer and Lian was like a god fighting in the celestial world, and soon the entire labyrinth of Andre was about to pour down.

"More! More! More!"

Imer sensed victory.

'I'm going crazy! I'm angry!'

It was so unfair and frustrating.

"Do more! Do it! Is this the end!"

The recoil and pain that burst when the body and body collided were so lovely.

'Is it over like this?'

A being that was sealed in the hardest ice in the world because even Anke, who was close to God, could not control his biological strength.

'How long has it been since I felt this shock...!'

Imer couldn't control his anger.

"Uaaaaaa!"

As the fists collided and Lian's heartstrings twisted from the wrist and burst out, his right arm flew away.

"Kueuuuu!"

Nevertheless, Lian's body was still advancing.

"You weak child!"

When Imer's fist hit his abdomen, his body shot up vertically and stamped a mural on the ceiling.

"Cough!"

As the body hardened and stuck to the ceiling fell down, Kido hurriedly ran.

"Lian, are you okay?"

Imer bragged and shouted.

"Is it just that you woke me up!"

"Wake up, Lian! Li......!"

Kido, who touched Lian's body, shivered.

'All the bones are shattered.'

Perhaps the internal organs were melted like dead by the shock wave.

"Just because you chew on my teeth... do you swing an unbreakable sword?"

There are many objects in the world that have functions beyond imagination, but Imer knows.

What does not break is the strongest.

'Even with the strongest weapon, the guy who can't even swing properly...'

Looking at Lian, who had spread out on the ground, Imer's head was intertwined with the memory of a while ago and a very long time ago.

"Come to think of it..."

Imer's gaze was aimed at Shirone.

"Did he hold on because of that guy?"

When he showed his will to live to Shirone, Lian's body went through a bone-breaking ordeal and reached now.

"Hehehe, memories are flooding back."

When Imir completely turned to Shirone, Sung-eum was startled and shouted.

"Get up quickly! You have to fight or run away!"

"Go. I am Lian... Kido..."

Moon Kyung shouted at Sung-eum.

"Princess! Let's avoid it for now! The situation is not good!"

Thanks to Shirone, Imir was prevented from being pierced, but it was unthinkable that there would be a second chance.

'Yes, I need to come up with a new way.'

Sung-eum, who made a decision, cast an ether wave.

"I will definitely save you! I can't end up in debt like this! I'll take you!"

Sung-eum, who distorted Shirone's space, saw Shirone's eyes still full of fighting spirit.

"Kuk!"

You shouldn't take it like this.

"Get up."

Sung-eum, who released the ether wave, ran to Shirone and grabbed his shoulder.

"Get up! You can fight, can't you!"

"Princess..."

Moon Kyung was stunned by the sight of Sung-eum eliminating his own distance and grabbing Shirone.

"It's not running away! First, take some time and come up with a way..."

"I'm fine."

Shirone raised his head with a pale complexion.

"Because Lian is protecting me, I'm fine."

Sung-eum, who checked the still motionless Lian's condition, turned his head again.

"That swordsman is dead. No one can protect you."

"Then it can't be helped."

"What?"

Shirone smirked.

"If my sword is broken... I have no choice but to die."

As soon as the words fell, Lian's shoulder, which had been lying down, twitched and convulsed.

"Li, Lian..."

Kido's voice was heard and Imir turned around, and Lian, whose eyes were turned upside down, was standing with his teeth clenched.

"There... don't move a step."

"Hehehe."

The corners of Imir's mouth were torn.

"Hahaha! Hahaha!"

Regardless of whether the prediction was correct, he was just happy to be able to fight a little more.

"Yes, I know the way now."

He approached Shirone and Sung-eum and said.

"So this guy is your ideal. Then I'll break it. I'll crush your limbs in front of you."

If it was Imir, he could do it.

"In my heart..."

Lian, who clenched his teeth so hard that his molars would crumble, blew strength into his whole body and said.

"The kingdom of faith."

Whoosh! Whoosh!

As the muscles of the whole body twisted and numerous swirl shapes appeared on the skin, Kido's face turned pale.

"...Raise it."

As the shape of the muscles, which was different from any creature, climbed up the neck and even twisted the facial muscles grotesquely.

'Goblin.'

It was a thought that suddenly came to Sung-eum's mind.

"Very good! Rather, kill this guy now...!"

Before Imir's words ended, his neck was twisted, and the figure of Lian, who had hit his face, appeared belatedly.

'Yes, that guy...'

In Imir's mind, recalling the pain of the distant past, the face of one person passed by.

'It was Yacha.'

In Jincheon, Yacha is called a goblin.

"Uaaaaa! Uaaaaa!"

As a tremendous storm of power raged, sparks burst in front of Imir's eyes, and his vision was completely filled with white light.

'I am also a collective of over 10 billion humans.'

Humans are really strange.

'Even though they have such a weak body...'

Rather, the mind is endless and.

'While loving to destroy...'

It becomes strongest when protecting something.

'Ogent.'

Smile.

"Hahaha!"

Imir sensed the end of the game.

"It was a great battle!"

At the same time as he swung his fist with the greatest power ever, Lian's eyes burned fiercely.

Transcendence of God - Shim Kwon Ma Ha.
