[669] Radum (4)

A magic of the shockwave series created by the combination of relatively minuscule mass and relatively extreme speed.

Although it looks like an explosion magic due to its tremendous destructive power, the essence of the angel's punishment was a shockwave occurring at supersonic speed.

As the torn and twisted structures stopped expanding and regained their place, all that was left were fragments like the remnants of a Galloper that burst into vibration.

'It's absorbed.'

Shirone watched the remnants of them seep into the fibrous floor.

It was creepy to think that perhaps the entire structure here was made of corpses.

"Is it over, is it over?"

In the quiet aftermath, Kohn muttered.

To his left and right were two golems injured by Galloper's attack, and when he released the spirit zone, they poured out as dirt and disappeared.

Even the pride of Veteran B was not even able to present a business card compared to the magic just before.

'Is that the magic of the Ivory Tower candidate?'

Arkman had already realized defeat, but the masters of the remaining two guilds were seeing Shirone's omnipotence for the first time.

No, even without limiting it to Shirone, this kind of bizarre magic was a first.

'Maybe...'

They might be able to survive in this hellish place.

While some saw a ray of hope, others were swallowed by the atmosphere of fear and fell into despair.

"Uh, uh."

When he turned his head to the sound of crying, Elwi, a member of the Blood Rose Guild, was shaking her shoulders with her fists clenched.

"Elwi, pull yourself together. You can't lose courage."

Master Evian comforted her, but once the emotions were stirred, they were not easily controlled.

"What should I do? The tears won't stop. I'm going to die."

"That's not true. You're alive now, aren't you?"

It was the first time that Elwi, a poison mage who had been sweeping the battlefield by spraying powerful nerve gas, showed such a weak side.

"You're wrong! No matter how hard I try, the fear won't go away! I'm going to die, I..."

Suddenly she opened her mouth with a sobbing sound.

What is truly scary is not fear, but oneself being eroded by fear, once you let go of your mind, you are sucked into endless darkness.

"Huh? Huh?"

Elwi's eyes were rolling in.

"Elwi! No! Hold on!"

Everyone sensed another death, then.

"It's okay."

Shirone hugged Elwi.

"Ah... Ah..."

As Elwi felt the warmth, her pupils gradually regained their place and death was temporarily postponed.

"Don't worry. No matter where this place is, I won't leave you to die in vain. Trust me and follow me."

A moment of relief crossed Elwi's face, but soon her lips drooped.

"Liar! You can say that because you're strong, Captain! In the end, the weak ones die first! Here, even nerve gas doesn't work!"

That was the root of the problem.

"Poison is useless here."

Shirone looked straight into Elwi's surprised eyes and explained softly.

"But when we get out of here, your magic will be a great help to our forces. If you weren't needed, you wouldn't have been chosen in the first place. So you can trust me."

"Really? Am I still needed?"

"Of course. And look, you're still alive and well."

Only then did Elwi realize that death had passed her by.

"You're a magician of Elwi's caliber, you can regain your mind at any time. So let's try a little harder, we."

Although she was a non-commissioned officer, Elwi was also a magician.

"Thank you."

When Elwi, who had finally regained her senses, smiled, Shirone also smiled back.

But when she looked around and gave orders, her smile had already disappeared.

"It's dawn in biological time. It seems meaningless to move forward in this state, so let's find a place to rest."

There was no objection as the fatigue from the terrible environment was enormous.

The place we arrived at, avoiding the ghouls as much as possible, was the heart of a huge structure that must have been a large warehouse once.

"It's warm."

That was the only consolation, and disgust surged at that fact.

"What kind of world were we living in?"

When the atmosphere sank at Con's words, Shiroe ventilated it.

"Let's keep watch. We have enough people, so it would be good to set a rotation and rotate during the mission."

Kargen thought of a joke, 'What if someone dies in the meantime?' but did not spit it out.

"I'll go first."

Kuan, who was trained in this direction, staggered out of the heart.

"That person..."

He sighed in relief so that the members couldn't hear.

It had already been proven through the battle with Galloper that he was the best skilled among the mercenaries.

'It's awkward.'

It felt good to think that the bodyguard of diplomat Aria was protecting him, and that's why Kuan volunteered for the first watch.

"Close your eyes for a while. We will depart in 3 hours."

It couldn't be enough rest, but in this battlefield, it was said to sleep to survive.

Nevertheless, most of the members could not fall asleep.

As consciousness sank, it felt like the heartbeat of the structure was heard louder.

'Neo....'

Joshua, the archer who got up from his seat, opened the pendant around his neck.

"Is it a lover?"

When he quickly turned his head at the sudden voice, Kargen was grinning.

"Mind your own business. The inspiration is disgusting."

"Have you ever been interested?"

She opened her mouth after thinking for a moment.

"What do you want?"

Kargen pointed to the pendant with his chin.

"Is it a lover?"

"No."

There was a picture of a four-year-old child in the pendant.

"It's my son."

"Hmm, I didn't know you were married?"

"I didn't. I don't even know who the father of the child is. I was immature at the time...."

If you live a mercenary life for a long time, you can meet quite a few men who want to spend the night for money.

In some cases, the income was better than the mission, so Joshua accepted when he felt like it, but it was a mistake not to be careful and not to use contraception.

Kargen, who couldn't help but know the physiology of mercenaries, skipped the details and asked.

"Are you so obsessed with money because of your son?"

"He's dead."

The pendant closed with a thud.

"It was a fever. It was infected with a virus or something. There was a cure. I just didn't have the money."

Joshua's words ended there.

"That's too bad."

Was it because of hell, it sounded sincere.

"You? Do you have a family?"

Kargen grinned bitterly.

"Unfortunately, I've been a bachelor so far. A true bachelor. Of course, I'm not a virgin."

Joshua chuckled at the stale joke.

"It's not a joke. Do you want to check?"

When Kargen took a posture to lower the hem, Joshua turned his head coldly and said.

"You're a crazy old man."

"Giggles, what does it matter? There's nothing like this to overcome fear. Besides, they say the senses have changed, so you might be able to taste a new realm."

"Why me? There's a beautiful monk over there, and there's a diplomat from a country."

"That's because you're the prettiest."

It was a blatant lie, but it didn't feel bad.

"How much will you give?"

"What?"

"You said I'm pretty? Call me from your side."

Kargen hesitated for a moment and took out the highest-grade gold coin from the cubic.

When Joshua said he would take it in cash, Kargen also had no family.

"This is all my fortune."

100,000 gold received from Lupist, all of it was in his hand.

"Even if it rots, it's Junichi."

He was a genius who knew how to move people.

She, who had snatched 50,000 gold from Kargin, put it in a cubic and got up from her seat.

"I'll only take half. Let's go out the back door."

Kargin, who awkwardly took the remaining gold, followed and asked.

"I really don't care......"

"Don't throw your life away for such a thing. I'm definitely going to survive, so enjoy it then, you old man."

Some were asleep, but the core members, including Shirone, were lost in thought in the corner, and Joshua looked at Shirone as if asking for permission.

When Rufist gestured to do as he pleased, the two left through the back door.

"Are you okay?"

"Why? You want to relax a bit too?"

Shirone was not in the mood for a joke.

"It's dangerous. Given the characteristics of this world, any emotional changes can affect......"

"Don't expect too much. They're also desperately holding on. If we push them any further here, they'll really die."

It was a fact that could be known because he was the president of the association with many subordinates.

The core members, including Shirone, are the owners of mental power that is counted in the kingdom, but the stress received by ordinary mercenaries in a situation where they die just because they are scared exceeded imagination.

Considering the situation of Elwi, it was not that Shirone could not understand, so she glossed over that part.

"Um...... Miss Meirei."

"Oh, yes?"

She, who had been blocking her ears and experimenting with the frequency of God, turned her head.

"You said it was a trust earlier, right? What exactly is that?"

Jane is thinking about a way to escape, but there is no particular result now, so Meirei's information was important.

"Oh, that's right."

She, who sat next to Shirone, explained.

"Actually, it's ambiguous to call it a memory. The process of trust is so dreamy. But I suddenly remembered when I came here. Some information comes up like that."

"You said it was a back world, right?"

"Yes. But that's just a term I interpreted. They perceive the world with much more diverse senses than humans. They probably don't distinguish between the world we live in and this place."

"Why didn't you tell me earlier?"

"Actually...... I just remembered it now."

If it was a free association technique, it could have been drawn out more through conversation.

"What does integration mean?"

Meirei blinked for a moment and then opened her mouth.

"Do you remember when I told you about the touch?"

"Yes. Miss Meirei is blue."

"When I heard about the ability called Time Bomb, the first thing that came to mind was that. You probably opened the sixth sense completely."

"Me?"

"The Terraforce Sect, no, to be precise, the Terraforce gods classify the types of senses into eleven. Humans are beings of five senses, but some sensory entities understand the universe with more senses. Do you know what the peak of sensation, the 11th sense, is called?"

When Shirone shook her head, she pointed at Shirone.

"It's called the ultimate system."

"Ultima is...... the eleventh and last sense?"

"I know, you have the ultimate sense of Gaia. But interpreting the signal is not the essence of Ultima. The sixth sense of humans is manifested by the integration of the five senses. The seventh sense is manifested by the integration of the six senses. When you reach the 11th stage through this kind of integration, everything becomes one. This seems to have been the knowledge of the Terraforce gods."

As if more information was pouring out, Meirei's words sped up.

"Humans are beings of five senses, so the manifestation of the sixth sense is temporary. But you opened it perfectly. The sixth sense they talk about, the sense of time explosion. It's a clear feeling that transcends time."

By now, not only Rufist but also Jane had come and was listening attentively.

"If you really want to open the eleventh sense, you have to keep integrating and opening new senses. I don't know if it's biologically possible, but at least they did."

I hope this helps! If you have any other texts you need translated, feel free to ask.

"How many senses do you have? I'm talking about teraflops."

"I'm not sure exactly. It's clear that I haven't reached the 11th sense, but it won't be low either. Anyway, since I opened my 7th sense, I would know about this place."

Jane asked as if she had suddenly thought of something.

"You said that the sense of explosion undermines time. Then what about the 7th sense?"

"Yes. It breaks down the barriers of space. A sense that nullifies the boundary between existence and non-existence."

Mairei spread her palms wide as if there was a wall in front of her.

"7th sense, Bak Ji-bo Ji."

It was another sense to reach the ultimate.
