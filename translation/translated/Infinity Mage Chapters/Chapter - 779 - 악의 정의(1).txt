[779] Definition of Evil (1)

When Shirone and Uorin returned to the room, Minerva had placed the "Law Spear" on the table.

To her right were people playing card games - Gudio, Agaya, Ness, Mice were sitting in order.

"Have you calmed down?"

Minerva smiled as if it wasn't her responsibility, and Uorin responded with a smile.

"I'm sorry. I showed a bad side to my immature younger sibling."

Now that he had confirmed Shirone's feelings, there was no reason to be swayed by Minerva anymore.

'Something happened.'

The sight of Mitochondrial Eve far surpassed that of ordinary people, so Minerva gave up on the idea of digging into it.

"Let's talk about work. As promised, I brought the 'Law Spear'. Now tell me how you're going to punish the wicked."

Uorin turned his gaze to the people playing cards and gave a meaningful smile.

"Some great people have come."

Uorin couldn't not know the faces of the four best gamblers in the world.

'The Ivory Tower is quite concerned. These people will be of great help in handling the 'Law Spear'.'

When Shirone took a seat next to Minerva, Gando served tea, and finally Uorin sat down.

"You probably guessed, but the wicked I'm targeting is the Emperor of the Gustav Empire, Gustav Habitz."

The eyes of the people playing cards narrowed.

"The Gustav Empire has already prepared for war. A world war will break out within the next 48 hours."

Some nobles near the border have already sorted out their assets and fled to other countries.

Uorin spread out a world map.

"The beginning of the war will be here, the Cotria Republic."

The Cotria Republic, a peninsula country protruding towards the Pacific from the northern continent, was under pressure from the Gustav Empire.

"Gustav can't expand without getting rid of the Cotria Republic. Of course, it should have been eaten already, but......"

Minerva said.

"Ancient weapon Exmachina."

"Yes. I'll explain later, but that's why Gustav hasn't invaded the Cotria Republic yet. But once a full-scale war breaks out, occupation is only a matter of time."

Shirone asked.

"What is the Cotria Republic's judgment?"

"They haven't made an official statement. They're probably weighing the Holy War and Gustav. Depending on which side they join, the fate of their country will be divided."

Minerva chuckled.

"If it were me, I would definitely join the Gustav Empire. It's too geographically disadvantageous. By the time the Valkyrie supports, their country will already be in ruins."

"I think the same. So they're probably negotiating an alliance behind the scenes. But the problem is, if Habitz is really wicked, he won't accept the proposal."

"In the end, the key is Habitz. You're saying it's best to kill the wicked as quickly as possible before the damage from the war gets worse?"

"That's right. That's why we need the 'Law Spear'."

If Habitz, who broke the perfectly meshed three-power structure, dies, the balance will return.

Uorin looked at the people playing cards.

"What you have to do is design a law that can definitely kill Habitz through the ability of the 'Law Spear'. You can change any part - human, emotion, money, culture, law. All support will be from the Holy War."

"It won't be easy."

Gudio said, and the card players kept silent as if they agreed.

"Of course. It's about killing the emperor. That's why I called you, the world's best gambler."

"We're not the best in the world."

Mice looked at Uorin with torn eyes.

"There's probably no one who knows how we met and why we came to the Ivory Tower."

"What are you talking about?"

Bald old man Agaya said.

"Yes, we were the best in the world at one time. But we have one thing in common. We lost to the same person 14 years ago."

It was the first time Minerva heard this story.

"You lost? To whom?"
[Translated block]


The face of Ness, like a skull, darkened even more.

"It seems to be called Gustav 4th now. The god of war, Vulcan."

Woorin recalled the rugged impression of Vulcan, who looked like a bandit in the holy war.

"What's the winning rate?"

Gudio spoke.

"There's no such thing as a winning rate. Because he hasn't won a single game. In any game where winners and losers are divided by rules, Vulcan does not lose."

He thought there couldn't be such a difference.

"How is that possible? No matter how great a gambler is, he can't beat the odds."

Agaya shook her head.

"I don't know. I calculated perfectly, but after the game, I feel like I was bewitched. It's like he's the only one who knows the rules of the game."

"It's not about probability."

Ness, shocked 14 years ago, said with force in his eyes.

"He reads the atmosphere."

It's also called crowd energy.

The imperial city of the Gustav Empire, Marschak.

Along with the underworld of Jincheon, Aganos of Kashan, it is one of the largest artificial structures in the world.

While each department was busy preparing for war, only the military Vulcan was quietly playing chess.

Hundreds of chess boards were connected.

"What are you doing? Move quickly!"

The 23 imperial soldiers facing Vulcan were racking their brains looking at the positions of over 2,000 pieces.

'I don't know. What should I move?'

It's common to see a winning trend in a game with just one chess piece, whether you win or lose.

Just by moving the first piece, the possibility of the future drops exponentially.

'But if hundreds of boards are connected...'

It goes beyond the realm of sensation that cannot be calculated by human brain and loses the standard of probability.

"Let's move this."

After discussing with 23 people, they moved the pawn on the chess board at position 127 horizontally and 278 vertically.

'I don't know.'

The pieces can use all the connected chess boards, and therefore, they could not be sure whether the current choice was correct.

"That's a foolish judgment."

The soldiers flinched at Vulcan's words.

"If you respond like this, there's no way, right?"

A bishop on a chess board that seemed to have nothing to do with the soldiers' move, at position 7 horizontally and 16 vertically, moved.

'I have no idea. What's the connection?'

If the pieces move about 2,000 more times, something might be seen, but the number of choices that the soldier and Vulcan can make until they reach 2,000 is infinite.

'Prediction is impossible. It's not a matter of calculation, it's completely open in terms of probability. It's just the beginning.'

But why has he never won?

'In the end, as the general said, the game ends.'

The soldiers looked at Vulcan, who was blessed by both the literary and military gods, with fearful eyes.

'What does he see in his eyes...?'

From the edge of the board where hundreds of boards were laid out, Vulcan twisted his waist and looked down at the battlefield.

'That place is weak.'

The golden melody swirling among thousands of pieces was clearly visible to his eyes.

The soldiers moved the pieces to the point where the light was particularly weak among the lights filling the board.

"That's a weak judgment."

Even a servant can calculate the whole shape in which the pieces are arranged.

'It would be easier to give up.'

The atmosphere denies probability.

What the atmosphere sees is not the shape, but the gaze of the crowd that changes every moment due to the shape.

"Let's stop. You guys have already lost."

"The emperor?"

"Ah, as far as I know, he's taking a walk in the palace...."

"It's so boring I could die."

Vulcan yawned and said.

"Why is the day so long today?"

Shirone asked.

"Is he such a tough opponent?"

The people playing the card game answered unanimously.
[Translated block]


"It's difficult."

The baby lifted his index finger.

"One could say that the crowd machine is not an objective probability, but the apex of relative response. In other words, there is no winner in a game with an opponent. If such a person is next to Habits, it should be enough to respond to the law of 'Balsal'."

"But also......"

Ness said.

"That's why it's worth breaking the enemy. We will definitely win this gamble."

The fighting spirit of the card players flared up.

"Good. Let's start the analysis now. First, we need to know our enemy."

Woorin looked back at Shiro.

"Evil. Have you ever met in your life?"

"Hmm, I wonder? I've met quite a few bad people......"

Minerva pointed to herself.

"Me?"

"You're not evil."

Woorin shook his head.

"Of course, Minerva, you're a really bad kid, but evil is not a quality that can be expressed to that extent."

Minerva pouted her lips.

"So you probably don't want to hear it......"

This is a story.

"You'll want to avoid it all your life."

It's a story about the most distant human being in the world, evil.

"Please save me! My husband is dying!"

A woman in the commoner area of Huangcheng Marshak was screaming in the street.

"What's going on?"

The man who hurriedly ran was a 50-year-old man dressed as a clown with a drum on his back.

"Oh, that's......"

The woman who was about to ask for help frowned at the man dressed as a pharmacist.

"Can someone help me! My husband......!"

She didn't recognize the face of Zetaro, one of the four Gustav machines, who was a universal longevity.

"So tell me! I've learned medicine. Shouldn't people be saved?"

Zetaro was the best doctor in the empire.

"Can you really save him?"

It wasn't a matter to be taken lightly, so the woman decided to believe Zetaro's words.

"Here, here. He suddenly foamed at the mouth and fell."

Her husband was lying on the floor, and her young daughter and son were crying by the stairs.

"Let's take a look first."

Zetaro, who had quickly noticed the symptoms by looking at the husband's blood color and pupil reaction, said,

"Baskia virus, huh. Have you been to the lake in the last two months?"

"Huh? Oh, yes! He went fishing with his friends!"

Zetaro rummaged through the bag of the universal longevity and took out a brown bottle containing liquid.

"This medicine......"

"If he drinks it, can he live?"

"No, this is my medicine. I have a chronic disease."

The woman looked dumbfounded at Zetaro, who opened the cap of the bottle and gulped down the medicine.

"Please save my husband! You can save him, right?"

"Baskia virus. The treatment is......"

Zetaro, who was hesitating with a scalpel, bit his lip and suddenly screamed.

"How the hell would I know that!"

He, who was glaring at the ceiling with bloodshot eyes, stabbed the husband's chest with a scalpel.

"Kaaaa!"

The woman screamed, and the children rolled their eyes at the sight of the blood splattering.

"What, what...... what are you doing......"

Zetaro, who had already been vaccinated, put a bucket of hot blood on his face and went outside.

"Hey, Zetaro. I'm hungry, want to go eat something?"

Habits in shabby clothes and Natasha in a suit approached with the guards.

"Your Majesty, another life has disappeared. It's so, so sad......"

Unable to bear the unbearable sadness, Zetaro could not continue his words.

"I'll play a tune."

He, who was hopping on his left foot and pushing his right foot to beat the drum, blew the trumpet.

"Toorubaptoodo. Toorubapbaptoo."

The trumpet sound played by the best singer in the empire touched the hearts of the passers-by.

"You bad kids! Killing a husband and doing what......"
