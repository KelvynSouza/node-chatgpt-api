[195] 6. The Liquor of the Day (4)

Pheope's face froze when she heard Shirone's words.

She couldn't understand what was happening in her mind. As hope of survival emerged, the strong emotions that had dominated her began to disappear like bubbles.

"Are you mocking me? What do you gain by humiliating me?"

"Mocking? Don't make me laugh. It's only natural to spare someone who begs for their life. Because I also want to live. Because I value my life, I know how precious other people's lives are."

Shirone had not decided to let go of Pheope. It was still uncertain what decision he would make at the last moment.

He just thought of Kanya and Lena. He couldn't let them die like this.

"I'll count to three. One."

He put more strength into his hand that was holding Pheope.

"Two."

"Please, spare me."

Pheope said in a small voice.

Shirone didn't loosen his grip as if he hadn't heard her. And just as he was about to say three, Pheope, who had closed her eyes tightly, shouted.

"Spare me! Please! I don't want to die!"

Shirone let go of Pheope.

She regained her freedom and flew up with her wings trembling. Her face was red like a sunset and she snapped at him.

"Do you think you can get away with this?"

"What did I do?"

"You tried to kill me!"

"That's right. And that's exactly what you did to Kanya and Lena."

Pheope couldn't argue back.

She was born as an executor of the law and had never thought deeply about the lifespan of the mortals.

But when she entrusted her life to someone else's hands, she realized it was a complicated issue.

Death was scary and life was sweet. It was the same for fairies who lived for 10,000 years.

"I think what happened to Kanya's mother was wrong too. Give her back her lifespan."

Before she could sort out her thoughts, he pressed her and Pheope got annoyed.

"I told you before! Only the upper ranks of the 72 classes of fairies can touch the lifespan register. I can't reverse a case that has already been judged."

"Then at least redo the judgment for Kanya and Lena. You can do that, right?"

Pheope rested her chin on her hand and pondered.

"Well... then I'll reduce it by one year."

Shirone snorted.

He was glad that Kanya and Lena's sins had been lightened, but the gap in judgment was too big. He wondered if there was no standard from the beginning.

"What are you, some kind of junk dealer? How can you judge so arbitrarily?"

"This is already a bargain! Do you want me to raise it to 20 years?"

"That's not what I'm saying. Don't you think it's strange? You need a standard to apply the sins."

"That's why I'm the standard. I'm the executor of the law! You're really ignorant, aren't you?"

Shirone stopped talking. He had to admit that fairies were a different species from humans who diverged at some point.

The fairy's thinking was more inclusive than human's thinking. While humans could split love into countless concepts, love was just love for fairies.

Pheope was an executor of the law and therefore did not doubt her own thoughts. She knew how scary death was, so she reduced it by one year.

She couldn't make detailed judgments like two years and three months or seven years and six months.

Her thinking would deepen after thousands of years, but her current age was only one year old.

"Are you done now? Then I'll go. Fairies have a lot of work to do."

"Where are you going? You have to solve Kanya's mother's problem too."

Pheope looked back at Shirone and glared at him.

"How can I solve that? I wasn't even born at that time. And my position is the youngest of the 72 classes of fairies, so I don't have the authority to modify the lifespan register."

"Then at least tell me how. You're a fairy, so you must know something. I won't let you go until you tell me."

Pheope was temperamental like a spiral spirit, but she wasn't hard to handle because she was young. He thought there might be a way to save Kanya's mother if he got some information from her.

How is my translation?

“Hmph, you think I can't go out just because you block me? And no one can interfere with the affairs of the fairy realm. This is determined by the law.”

“What is that law? You know it's unreasonable, right? Life is precious. How can you arbitrarily reduce someone's lifespan by 20 years?”

Peope blinked back tears.

She didn't know, actually. To judge the right and wrong of the law by her own standards, she felt like she had to live at least 600 years.

“Why do you keep doing this to me? I'm just doing what I'm told!”

“When did you become an executor of the law? You were so confident before, and now you're running away?”

“Ugh, really! What do you want me to do? What do you want to know?”

“First of all, tell me what the Elixir of One Life is.”

“The Elixir of One Life? It's a sacred elixir technique. It refines the law of the divine people and makes them reborn as new lives.”

Peope answered without hesitation, as if she finally knew something.

But Shirone couldn't feel anything from her words except for the wrapped-up justice.

“How can I understand that? Explain it in detail. What is its purpose, how does it work, what is the mechanism of the elixir technique, things like that.”

“Uh, so annoying...”

Peope clasped her head with both hands.

The Elixir of One Life was just the Elixir of One Life. She had never reviewed the information she knew as primal knowledge.

There was only one way left.

She brightened her eyes as she thought of memory transfer.

“If you really want to know, there's a way to explain it clearly. It's using mental resonance. Fairies can transfer their memories to others. I'll show you my memories of the Elixir of One Life. That should do it, right?”

Mental resonance was dangerous. Peope didn't seem like she would do anything bad, but she wasn't an ally anyway.

Arin spoke through the mental channel.

-It's okay. I can control Peope.

-Are you sure? Even if your defense is strong, there's something called an irregular pattern, right?

-Peope is emotionally immature, so she should be able to read the unique pattern of an irregular pattern with super vision. Then we can knock her out with a mental shock before it activates.

Canis and his companions seemed to have experienced an irregular pattern as well.

Thinking that super vision was amazing, Shirone expressed his consent to Peope.

“Okay. Show me your memories of the Elixir of One Life.”

“Alright. Then I'll start.”

Peope cast the memory transfer technique.

As Shirone and his companions' minds were sucked into the memory, the scene of the square a year ago appeared. It was where the statue of a giant stood, and the divine people were silent.

Shirone called his friends who had arrived at different points, and they came through the divine people like ghosts.

It was someone else's memory, but it was as clear as reality.

Shirone, who existed as a memory body, could examine anything he wanted. He was amazed that they didn't notice even if he stuck his face in front of their noses.

Shirone and his companions headed for where the statue was.

The barrier of people disappeared and a surprising sight unfolded.

Several hoses were connected to the statue of a giant, which were connected to eight glass spheres placed around it. The glass spheres were large enough for a person to enter.

The divine people were silent, but some were crying. The scene mixed with piety and despair gave off a sense of anxiety.

Kergoin ran around the statue preparing the elixir technique. Eight divine people walked out of the crowd. They were similar in age from 50s to 60s, but one was a young woman.

Shirone saw tears in their smiles.

Shaky pupils, trembling lips, sweat on their foreheads.

They were clearly thinking of death.

The subjects entered the glass spheres without a single straw on them.

As black water rose in the glass spheres, their families ran over crying. On the other hand, other divine people lay flat on the ground and began chanting Anke Ra.

Kergoin pulled away the families who were hitting the glass while calling out mom, dad, grandpa.

The subjects submerged in the rising water smiled.

Was it drowning?

It was a cruel thing.

Thinking that, Shirone gasped and backed away from looking inside the glass sphere.

It wasn't drowning. Their bodies were dissolving in the liquid.

It was the most grotesque sight he had ever seen.

He wondered about the composition of the liquid, and why it was black. If his family could see this process, they might have gone mad.

The liquid in the glass sphere was sucked in through a hose. It made a disgusting sound like excrement pouring out of a window.

The believers' voices shouting Ra grew louder.

As the water level in the glass sphere lowered, the transparent interior without any debris was revealed again.

There was nothing.

The people who were smiling just a moment ago had been sucked out through the hose.

Shirone turned his gaze to where the hose was connected. His body was already trembling. But he had to confirm it with his eyes.

The statue of the giant.

There, to that place, to the bottom of the statue, eight people were pouring down.

Then what on earth was it? What on earth was filling up the statue now?

The eternal Ra.

The sound of praising Anke Ra pierced the sky.

Suddenly, the statue of the giant vibrated strongly.

At that moment, the believers closed their mouths.

There was not a drop of water left in the glass sphere. It was all filled up in the statue of the giant.

Like a gourd.

Shirone shook his head. That couldn't be. But once he thought of it, he couldn't stop.

A gourd that melts humans and pours them in. Then what was being made inside...

The giant's figure opened up and showed a cross-section.

A huge foot pushed out and shook the ground.

Shirone shuddered at the sight of the giant wearing jelly upside down. His expression was too off to be called human.

Arin muttered through the mental channel. The reason why they couldn't mentally resonate with the giant, it was because multiple minds were mixed in one body.

Then what state were the minds in that body?

Were they eight minds, or something completely different from that?

The believers begged for mercy.

Those who are born by law and keep law. The giant.

Therefore, the giant had the right to execute those who violated law.

Even if someone was trampled under the giant's foot at this moment, it wouldn't be the giant's fault.

People who met eyes with the giant foamed at their mouths and collapsed. It was Pressing, an eye technique.

Ah.

Shirone shivered.

The origin of Schema. The original Schema was a phenomenon where human diagrams mixed with Ilhwa's alcohol overlapped.

They followed behind the giant and eavesdropped on the conversation of the believers.

The giant would leave heaven as it is and enter hell. There, he would execute heretics who threatened heaven and return to Matheus 5th after receiving Ra's call again.

Their families cried out in tears.

Mom! Dad! Grandpa!

As if responding to their voices, the giant flinched. But he didn't look back, and moved his steps toward outside of the gate as if nothing had happened.

@

The scenery in Peope's memory burned like paper on fire and revived as a house scene.

Shirone's party looked around them.

Peope was nowhere to be seen. He seemed to have run away while his memory was playing back.

But they didn't have time to care about him, as they learned what Ilhwa's alcohol was.

Ilhwa's alcohol subjects are decomposed in liquid. And they go into a gourd and undergo a special transformation process and are reborn as giants. People's minds are mixed up, and Schema occurs in that process.

The stimulant that Kanya bought meant that.

A hope to regain consciousness even a little bit in an unknown darkness.

Gardrak was right. It was no different from giving anesthesia to patients who were dying in pain.

"How can this be......"

Tes's face was pale without blood.

The ability Schema of giants. And his own ability Schema.

As soon as he thought that far, he ran to the corner and vomited. The food he had eaten earlier spilled out.

No one scolded Tess.

Everyone was disgusted.

When Lian approached, Tess raised his hand to stop him.

Of course, Peope's memory was not worse than the scene of the battlefield. It was just that a mental vomit came over him.

Schema is a giant's skill. But why could he open the schema? Did he have a separate bloodline of giants like Nephilim? But giants had no reproductive organs.

"You know why I didn't say anything, right?"

Kanya muttered with a sad expression.

Some call it a blessing, some call it a curse.

No one wanted to mention this event, which had divided opinions even among believers and heretics.

"According to the law, humans were born from giants. So returning to giants. That's the liquor of Ilhwa."

He couldn't accept Kanya's words even if they were true. The liquor of Ilhwa that Shirone witnessed was a monster that could not hide its true appearance with any makeup.

He finally realized it.

The liquor of Ilhwa performed in heaven was a technique of making giants with human flesh and guts as raw materials.
