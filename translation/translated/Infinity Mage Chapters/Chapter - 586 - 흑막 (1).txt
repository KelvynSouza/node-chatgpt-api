"Black Curtain (1)

“Damn it!”

Dorothy turned around in surprise at the curse that sprang from Iruki's mouth.

‘He's even getting angry.’

“Of course, Hershey knew. That a card beaten by a default does not shuffle.”

It was a rule that could not be detected in just 7 days unless it manipulated time like Shirone or had the computational ability of a servant.

“We are all trying to count the same way to make a favorable hand. If we continue like this, we will all die.”

“Who wins? You can calculate it, right?”

There were 28 scrambles left that had not yet been carded.

Then, it was possible to predict the outcome by calculating all of their cards and the patterns they would choose.

Iruki spoke with a click of his tongue.

“41 percent. It's our chance of winning.”

“Is the difference that big?”

“The winning rate doesn't matter anyway. Hershey has many possible cases. If you make a mistake once, we will be better off.”

“Will you make a mistake?”

“……I don't know.”

It was none other than Fermi's staff.

“Now we have no choice but to choose. If we fight to the end with a combination of defeats, the winning rate is 40 percent. But considering other variables…….”

Electricity sparked in Iruki's eyes.

“We can make a draw with an 80 percent chance.”

40 percent victory and 80 percent draw.

For Iruki, who was responsible for the battle of defeats, it was natural to lean towards the former.

‘40 percent is not a low winning rate. I have to do it.’

If Amy avoids Kaiden, if Shirone fails to destroy Eden's shield.

‘We have to fight considering all the negative situations. If I manipulate the white card…….’

“……Tsk. Iruki!”

“Huh?”

Iruki, who was out of his mind, turned to Dorothy.

“Don't think too hard. I trust your head.”

“But if you fall behind in the combination…….”

“You know what's more important. We are a team. Right?”

It wasn't just his own probability.

“Yes, that's right.”

It was everyone's probability.

“Let's get started. I'm going to feed you a shot.”

Dorothy nodded her head cheerfully.

* * *

“Haah! Haah!”

The mountain was on fire.

The maintenance time of the fire person was over, but the flames rose wherever Ifrit swept, illuminating the darkness of midnight.

‘Of course, continuous casting is difficult.’

In the pain that seemed to boil her whole body, Amy flew her body and a shock wave exploded.

Kaiden, who had turned over the dust, immediately revealed himself.

“Amyyy!”

His condition was no longer normal.

‘Sniper mode!’

Even while the cross of the spirit zone was rotating 300 times per minute, Fire Strike accurately aimed at Kaiden.

‘Air tunnel. It's definitely tricky.’

The speed of the flame flying with oxygen as fuel could not be followed unless it was the body sight of the schema.

‘Fast. Should I distance myself?’

Kaiden shook his head.

It was the most foolish judgment to give distance to a sniper.

‘I need to approach.’

That was the norm, but Amy also confronted Kaiden and reactivated the fire person.

As soon as Ifrit, who had been reborn seven times already, breathed in front of him, the wave of fire turned everything into ashes.

Magic Sword Skill-Shadow Barrier.

Kaiden, who had cast a dark magic in the midst of the ashes, broke through the curtain and rushed in.

‘Yeah! You're good!’

Amy realized why her stomach was boiling as the battle continued.

‘If you like Maya, you should go to Maya!’

Kaiden does nothing.

‘Who thinks dating is easy? Why do I have to give up my graduation evaluation and fight in this place…….’

“……Tsk. Iruki!”

“Huh?”

Iruki, who was out of his mind, turned to Dorothy.

“Don't think too hard. I trust your head.”

“But if you fall behind in the combination…….”

“You know what's more important. We are a team. Right?”

It wasn't just his own probability.

“Yes, that's right.”

It was everyone's probability.

“Let's get started. I'm going to feed you a shot.”

Amy's flame soared even higher.

"Do you know I'm fighting with you!"

"Woah!"

Magic Sword Skill - Mega Tornado.

As a strong wind rotated around Kaiden, Amy's flames followed the movement of the air.

'Frozen Buster!'

The endless vortex of flames that was being sucked in froze and exploded.

'You can do anything... about art!'

Kaiden really does nothing.

"How did I get up here!"

Amy also knew the weight of destiny to become the best.

'Do you think you can live by just doing what you want?'

So there was a time when she wandered.

If she hadn't met Shirone, her talent wouldn't have bloomed either.

'At the magic school...!'

Many competitors she met.

In the eyes that belittle the virtue of Hongan, there was a desperate desire to gain even a little talent.

'You're from the Cross family! You were born with the best talent!'

It's because she wants to become a wizard knowing their resentment.

Because she can't accept herself who has outstanding talent than others but can't achieve anything.

"Whine!"

"Die!"

Magic Sword Skill - Thunder Cross.

When Kaiden slammed the ground, a cross-shaped lightning bolt blasted all around.

"What the hell have you done!"

In the midst of the explosion, Amy's red eyes began to blink at an unprecedented speed.

Three-eyed evolution.

A state of extreme concentration that is impossible with just the ability to back up one's own memory, which is beyond imagination.

The Efreet, which had explosively increased in size, grabbed the cross sword and the blade heated up.

'I have to hold on! Just a little more!'

The nerve war that stabs consciousness again in the state of three eyes is beyond imagination.

Even the sound of grasshoppers sounds like thunder, and the state of concentration that seems to go crazy even if a single hair is shaken by the wind.

"That's it!"

Despite the pain of burning hands, Kaiden clenched the heated cross sword without hesitation.

"You're just a sacrifice to my destiny!"

The blade spewed out a pale white light.

Magic Sword Skill - Flash.

The blade cut Amy's neck at a speed like a flash of light.

"Huh!"

Even in front of the horizontal line of blinding light, Amy's red eyes did not disappear.

'Did you avoid it?'

It's impossible at Amy's schema level.

'No, didn't you cut it?'

Kaiden, who stopped swinging his sword, looked at the cross sword.

Only the black handle part where the iron water was dripping remained.

'Alloy....'

Heat enough to liquefy in an instant.

Amy, who had temporarily increased her firepower, rushed in while smoking from her body.

She can't cast a fire spell anymore, but Kaiden, who swung his sword in a photonized state, also had a backlash on his body and was in a difficult situation to move.

"Krrrr!"

At the moment when Sabina tried to move her limbs with all her might, Amy came deep into Kaiden's arms.

"Whether it's Maya or you....!"

A fist full of soul was stuck in Kaiden's ribs that Shirone had broken a few days ago.

"I can't give up Shirone!"

Woojijijik!

Hearing the sound of the ribs breaking, Kaiden vomited blood.

"Cough!"

At the same time, Amy also felt pain in her wrist and frowned.

"Ouch!"

It was clear that the ligament was out.

"Shirone is...."

Kaiden, who distorted his face, trembled and glared at Amy.

But only for a moment, the solid body like an iron wall fell back emptily.

* * *

"Ew! Disgusting!"

Sabina cut off the insects coming from all sides with an air cut.

It was just magic, but it was even more grotesque because of it, and the functions such as poison, paralysis, and mental abnormalities were also various.

'Oh, I don't know!'

When Sabina cast Cutting Flower, the blade of the wind tore the body of the thing with six legs.

The attack, which boasted both speed and accuracy, finally laid hundreds of bugs on the floor, vomiting slime.

"Whew! Is it over now?"

Pisho had disappeared before I knew it.

The only role he could play in a state where all the scrambles were exhausted was to check, but he was not foolish enough to rush headlong into a combat wizard.

'Just as Iluki said.'

Even after Pisho hid his figure, Sabina, who waited for a long time, checked the time and looked up at the sky.

Rocket Punch (→→↘↘←←).

Dorothy's magic, Hickory's Rocket Punch, delivered a scramble to her.

* * *

"It's over."

Hershey and Iluki glared at each other.

The result of the fierce combination fight was Iluki ○●○○●○ (amplification), Hershey ●●●●●ⓡ.

If the random card is black, Hershey can beat Iluki, and if it is white, it becomes a full house.

'It's a gamble worth trying.'

According to the calculation through counting, the ratio of black and white left in the random card was four white cards and six black cards.

"I win with a 60% chance."

It was remarkable that Hershey's brain was excellent just because it followed the winning rate predicted by Iluki.

"No, it's a draw with an 80% chance."

Then Dorothy put a kang on Iluki.

Her ●○●●○● (extinction) caused Iluki's card to be beaten, and the ratio of black and white became 8 to 8.

Then the probability is 50%.

"You threw away the card? It's an absurd gamble."

"Really?"

When Iluki pointed to one empty arm of Hickory, Hershey, who realized something, looked at the master card.

○○○○ (Pope) Sabina's hand had been beaten and ●●●● (mine) was floating.

Now there are sixteen white cards and four black cards.

In other words, it was a situation where a white card would come out with an 80% chance.

"......Are you going to catch me anyway?"

It was a strategy that could not be attempted without being sure that Shiro-ne would retire Eden.

"Well. This is a team game."

Perhaps a black card could come out with a 20% chance, so Hershey picked up a random card.

"Open."

As soon as ●●●●●○ (full house) was confirmed, Hershey threw the white card on the ground with a click of his tongue.

'So four scrambles are empty.'

It was a margin created because Shiro-ne did not use a scramble from the beginning.

'Sabina sent exactly 4.'

The only question left for Hershey was one.

"How did you catch the timing of dozens of times? Did you just leave it to luck?"

Even if you calculate the hand, predicting the change in real time is impossible with human thought.

"Because it's a servant."

The answer Iluki gave was simple.

"Servants don't forget time. And...... Dorothy's clock is 5 minutes slower."

Dorothy shrugged her shoulders and smiled.

* * *

With an impassable bridge between them, Shiro-ne and Eden flew in the sky and pursued each other.

The attack and defense were one-sided, but it was a strange battle where no one had any results.

'As expected, it can't be destroyed with ordinary magic.'

All kinds of magic applications were being hammered into Eden through the ability of Shibulsangpokmae, but she couldn't damage a single hair of hers.

'I have to be prepared to kill.'

Shining Chain went ahead by one second and restrained Eden, but her expression was full of leisure.

"You can't hurt me with this anyway."

'Ataraxia!'

The moment Ataraxia unfolded, Eden's laughter began to harden with astonishment.

'What is that?'

The Ataraxia, which distorts the surrounding scenery and accumulates, was completely different from yesterday.

"Sphere?"

4-dimensional Ataraxia, which added time to 3-dimensional space.

It was a marvelous phenomenon that only Shiro-ne, who perceives the past, present, and future at the same time, could show.

'More! Faster!'

Accumulating information in a sphere was different from a 2-dimensional magic circle, but that's why it pulled up 100 trillion Shibulsangpokmae.

"......Are you going to catch me anyway?"

It was a strategy that could not be attempted without being sure that Shiro-ne would retire Eden.

"Well. This is a team game."

Perhaps a black card could come out with a 20% chance, so Hershey picked up a random card.

[Translated block]


As the world shrinks to a point, the light of countless information is stuck in the ataraxia of the sphere, and Eden also realized the seriousness of the situation.

"Ugh!"

The moment she expanded the barrier and broke the shining chain and moved away from Shiron, the 4-dimensional ataraxia was completed.

'Elysion!'

The center of the spirit zone disappeared as the realm of the straight was opened.

'I don't know what kind of magic it is, but I don't need to deal with it. It's just enough to avoid it.'

At the same time as Eden's thought ended, the battery and omnipotence of the photon cannon were combined in Shiron's head.

"This is......"

Eden shivered at the sight unfolding before her eyes.

A huge flash was pouring in from all directions that humans could confirm around her.

"Ugh!"

And finally, it condensed like the sun and made Eden unable to move.

The sense of enormous mass being concentrated into a point through the absolute barrier was quite terrifying.

"Ugh......!"

Is this sacredness.

Or is it the most violent enemy in the universe.

'Please hold on! Eden!'

The super-high-density condensation of stars flying from all time, all space, combining ataraxia, sublimation explosion, and Elysion.

Shiron's extinction magic, Quasar.
