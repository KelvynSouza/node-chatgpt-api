[554] The Power of a Day (3)

* * *

D-36 days.

From the day after the sequence exceeded 1 quadrillion, Shirone's skills grew rapidly enough to be called acceleration.

His eyes bulged as the numbers unfolded from 1 began to accelerate endlessly, entering the unit of quadrillions.

'2 quadrillion!'

He was counting the numbers, but he no longer felt like he was reading them.

It was a state where numbers flowed endlessly in his thoughts, like blood flowing along his veins.

'3 quadrillion!'

Through a huge realization that allowed him to set foot in a new realm, Shirone's numbers raced without end.

'4 quadrillion!'

As the numbers grew, so did the emotions that overwhelmed him, and a look of puzzlement appeared in Miro's eyes, who had been watching the training.

'Huh? What's this?'

Shirone's avatar was in the form of an angel with wings of light.

Also, as the sequence progressed, the afterglow of light disappeared and the outline became clearer.

However, after exceeding 4 quadrillion, the outline began to distort, and even parts of it were collapsing.

'Is the change starting now?'

When you reach the realm of unity with water, the spirit of prajna can influence the laws of things.

However, just by collapsing the form, he could not even guess what kind of personality was contained in Shirone's avatar.

"Huh!"

Shirone, who was breathing roughly, trembled with a shocked expression and knelt down with a thud.

Miro came a little closer and asked.

"How many?"

"It ended at 5 quadrillion."

Half without energy.

'It's a psychological brake.'

He had absorbed some technique of the sequence that could be understood in the unit of quadrillion and destroyed more than 4 quadrillion in an instant, but the thought of half the goal created a new limit.

"I told you before, don't be obsessed. Only flexible thinking like water can break the limit."

"Yes."

Of course, if it were as easy as saying, there would be no failure in the world.

"I'll try again."

Miro was satisfied with the fact that Shirone no longer made a groaning sound.

'The desire for success has overcome the fear of failure.'

Failure, failure, endless repetition of failure.

But if you don't give up, it's not a failure, it's absorbed as many experiences necessary to reach success.

'You're doing well, Shirone. People who have never fallen can't walk.'

It's not about training to get a sweet title like a 'genius' magician or a 'monster-like powerful' magician.

'Fail a lot. It's not embarrassing. Rather, it's something to be proud of.'

A 'trained' magician who can cope with any variables.

'That's your pride and the highest medal a pro can have.'

Shirone, who was staring at the world of numbers and concentrating, had a distorted nose.

'I'm going to be a magician! I will definitely become one!'

D-34 days.

Dorothy's room was hot with anger and dizzy with the smell of pleasure.

On the bed was Dorothy, who was lying crookedly and buried in the blanket, and a sound that was confusing whether it was joy or crying pierced the barrier of cotton and leaked out.

"Ah! Ah!"

Next to the bed, the scrap metal doll Hickory was completely smashed and scattered.

"Ah! Ah!"

He thought he had almost completed it, but at the last moment, all sorts of errors burst out.

'Why now! Why do they all burst at once!'

The anger reached its peak, and the mind was distorted.

"Ah! Ah!"

At the moment when the blanket, which was curled up like a worm, was shaking roughly, the door was kicked open and the younger sister came in.

"Hey! What was that noise earlier? You broke something again!"

The movement of the blanket stopped, and the younger sister, who had been quietly looking around the room, frowned as if she knew this would happen.

"Anyway, psycho! What are you doing without showing your nose during the vacation! Do you know how worried mom is?"

At the continued nagging, Dorothy straightened her hunched body and sat on her knees.

"……Get out."

Her face, wrapped in a blanket, was drenched in cold sweat.

"Before you tell me to get out, you should keep quiet! You should consider the person living next door! All day in bed……!”

"Get out!"

Her younger sister flinched at the high-pitched scream.

She was always an abnormal sister, but this hysteria was no joke.

"Crazy…….”

As her younger sister fled the room, Dorothy pulled the blanket back over her head and curled up.

"Ah! Ahhh!"

A wailing groan escaped from under the blanket.

D-23 days.

For 20 minutes now, sparks were flying from Iruki's eyes.

As a massive amount of data flowed back into his head, which was calculating nuclear fusion, the blood vessels in his eyes began to burst.

Even as he shed tears of blood, Iruki's mouth was smiling.

'I can do it. Because I can.'

If you can't succeed, just keep trying until you do.

Data began to crash into the iron wall blocking the perfect formula at an incredible speed.

'It will open eventually.'

Even if it doesn't open, it doesn't matter.

Because the successful self beyond the iron door will open the door and come out to meet him.

D-21 days.

'Why? Why can't I move forward from here?'

Amy's face, spinning the spirit zone in sniper mode, was distorted with anger.

For several days, the accuracy of her sniping had not risen above 90%.

Amy, who had checked her own status backed up in her red eye, found a stagnation point in her psychological data.

'Stupid. You're satisfied.'

Because she felt that perfection was unnatural in her subconscious, she couldn't reach it.

'Your thinking is rigid! I need to destroy myself!'

As she spun the spirit zone, the 2-kilometer sniper zone spun at an incredible speed.

Every time she fired a fire strike at the target, the air rang with a thud.

The flame, accelerated down the air tunnel, reached the target in just 1.3 seconds.

'If it's not 100%, it's meaningless!'

Dozens of targets exploded simultaneously.

D-19 days.

"Good, Screamer! Smash it!"

"Ah! Ah! Ahhh!"

Screamer screamed in pain, but his body didn't stop.

He had reached a runner's high.

Pyroco, who had been blankly watching his son's frantic pounding, muttered in a choked voice.

"That's right, Screamer. That's it…….”

"What? What did you say!"

Screamer was annoyed at not hearing, but Pyroco was just proud of his son.

'You've finally surpassed it.'

There is a limit to becoming stronger because you want to beat someone, because you want to trample on the loser and feel superior.

'No, you can't be strong.'

Such low-grade pleasure is too easily discouraged in the face of the enormous pain that lies ahead.

'Screamer, do you know why so many people are risking their lives to compete?'

Because they don't want to lose.

They endure any pain because they can't admit that they can't do something.

'Become a magician, Screamer! Become a champion! Because that will be the greatest happiness in your life!'

"Dad! What are you doing!"

Pyroco suddenly came to his senses and wiped away his tears.

He must be in unbearable pain, so if he doesn't have any fighting spirit, he won't be able to endure it.

"Good, Screamer! You've finally got him groggy! The champion is completely out of it! Tear him apart! Finish him off!"

"Ahhhhhh!"

D-14 days.

The psychological break of reaching half of 1 경 did not easily disappear.

The sequence was still stuck at the limit of 5 trillion, and several days passed in that state.

'It's okay. I'm doing my best.'

Shirone was not anxious.

If you can't, you can't, and that's what it means to face reality coolly.

"Ha ha!"

Sitting on a rock by the stream, Shiro suddenly burst into laughter.

Looking across, he noticed that most of the leaves on the thirty-second branch of the tree on the other side had fallen down, but one leaf had risen up.

"That's really funny."

The fact that he could laugh at the direction of a leaf that no one else would even pay attention to was evidence of his flexible thinking.

"The spider has built a big house. That's nice."

During his training period, a spider web that would have been destroyed by rain and wind five times was hanging between the branches.

"That's really persistent. Right, there was a lot of wind last night."

He felt happiness in the sight of the spider stretching its thin legs and walking around the house.

"You've endured."

At that moment, his body tingled and he frowned.

"Huh? What?"

Tears poured out uncontrollably at the overwhelming emotion.

"Oh, I see."

There is no such thing as trivial.

"Well done. Well done, spider."

Even if it's just a trifle, even if it's a disgusting spider that no one else would even look at, if you look inside, there's a story as big as your own.

"There is a path everywhere."

As Shiro's spirit zone opened, the incarnation of an angel began to bloom.

As Elysion was activated, the boundary between the world and me disappeared, and the sequence began to run at an incredible speed, even forgetting the instructions of the maze.

3 trillion, 4 trillion, 5 trillion.

The limit that I thought was the limit was broken down, and the number began to pile up to a higher level.

"6 trillion! 7 trillion!"

As the incarnation of the angel collapsed further, Miro, who had been watching from a distance, smiled.

"All things in the world converge on life."

No matter what level, no transcendence can surpass living.

"I want to be a magician. That's also a great life that can't be compared with others."

Thinking that he might be able to reach it in time, Miro observed the changes in the incarnation.

"What?"

Miro's smiling face suddenly hardened.

As the sequence that had been running at 7 trillion entered 8 trillion, the form of the incarnation completely collapsed and the particles of light began to whirl around in many whirlpools.

The dazzling spectacle was overwhelming, but it was not a beautiful sight.

It was a grotesque whirlpool that felt hideous enough to be honest.

"No, it's not that level. It would be the same if I stood in front of the sun."

Feeling hideous is a human standard.

It was scary because it was a phenomenon that transcends all human experiences, even if you don't know what personality the incarnation has.

"What kind of singularity is it?"

As if space-time was distorted, the scenery was refracted and many afterimages were overlapping.

"The change is becoming clearer."

It was safe to say that there was not much left until the state of unity with water, having realized the fact that there is a path everywhere in the body.

"It seems like it's just a little more."

While cheering for the sequence as much as he was curious about Shiro's incarnation, the whirlpool of light suddenly disappeared as if it were a lie.

"Heuk! Heuk!"

Shiro, who had come out of the trance, was panting and then quickly turned around when he felt Miro's presence.

"Did you see it just now? I broke through! I went up to 9 trillion!"

"9 trillion... the abyss of perfection."

Contrary to his expectation of praise, Miro bit his lip and Shiro realized that he had violated the instruction.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was sequencing...."

"No, you did well. Even if you break through 5 trillion, you'll probably get stuck once more. Let's do our best to succeed during the remaining period."

"Yes!"

Shiro, who gained confidence, walked briskly to the training center.

On the other hand, Miro was still unable to leave his place and looked back at the rock where Shiro had been sitting.

It was a regrettable situation because he had almost reached it, but it was greedy to hope for more than this.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
