"More than anything, they far surpassed Mortasinger, who is over 10,000 years old.

"If you find the meaning, that's it. If you don't intend to follow my will, get out of here."

Already, other immortals of the same level have left the community following the executives of the Shiplo Association.

"The structure is not elsewhere. We will be by your side."

Among the Shiplo Association, Mortasinger was the only executive who relied on non-regulation food, not the realm.

"You don't need to sympathize. Because I'm strong enough."

The Shiplo Association is strong.

'So it's sad.'

A perfectly twisted human.

Even Geumgang Seung could not destroy her non-regulation food.

The first day of the conference was a place to introduce representatives from each country, and the identities of the veiled women were being revealed.

"Ladies and gentlemen! It's Miss Biden!"

Unlike her yawning in the waiting room, she appeared on stage like a shy girl.

"Wow! The best! It's Biden!"

Other participants spit out water inside at the sight of her turning her head slightly and blushing.

'It's totally hypocritical. Oh, my mouth is itching.'

After a brief self-introduction and interview, it was Miss Torumia's turn.

"Huh? I have to see this."

Shirone, who was walking around the conference hall checking for terror threats, stopped and stood on tiptoe.

"Don't be surprised! This Miss Torumia is a royal family representing the country!"

"Royal family?"

"Introducing! Alfred Pony!"

When Pony, who was fully dressed up, walked onto the stage, the audience greeted her with cheers.

"Pony?"

On the other hand, Shirone opened her eyes wide.

"What about school?"

Although various thoughts crossed, the conclusion was that she was much more beautiful than her school days.

'It's Maya and Pony. It's tricky.'

Finally, when the representative of Arachne, the host country of the conference, stepped forward, the biggest applause broke out.

"Rangida! Rangida!"

A man with hearts in his eyes, as if engraved, ran through the crowd and ran right under the stage.

"I love you!"

It was the man who had caught Shirone in the beauty contest parade and had given a long speech.

"Oh my?"

Rangida, who was familiar with the stage, did not panic and looked down, but the security guards caught him.

"Pull him out! What are you doing now!"

Rangida realized her destiny as if it were fate the moment she first saw Rangida.

"You're the one I've been looking for!"

As Shirone, who was watching the situation absurdly, suddenly turned her body at the chill running down her spine.

"What is it?"

At a distance that could not be confirmed with human eyes, a clear line of flesh was shooting in a straight line.

"It's a sniper!"

From the mountain side, numerous steel balls were flying into the conference hall.

'That is...?'

If Shirone's eyes were accurate, it was a weapon called Arc used by Mecha believers.

"Get down!"

Justin, who was the only one watching the mountain, moved first when he saw the steel ball.

He pushed all the participants with both arms and fell under the stage, but Rangida, who was in the center, could not avoid it.

"What...?"

The explosive beads were already within 200 meters, and her mind was dizzy with the shelling that covered the sky.

"Miss Rangida!"

The man who pushed the security guard ran up to the stage and threw his body with Rangida in a tackle.

"Kyak!"

In her eyes falling backwards, hundreds of steel balls were spinning like whirlwinds.

'Is it a dream?'

When the brain, which sensed death, activated the seesaw of time, particles of light bubbled like soap bubbles in the middle of the landscape.

'Shi...ro...'

Light constructs Shirone faster than the speed of thought.

'...ne?'

The beads, which received strong resistance, began to emit red flames like popping corn.

'From the highest place possible!'

Numerous beads that soared into the sky like whirlwinds exploded at the same time.

"Uh! It's a terror!"

As the audience scattered in all directions at the sound of shaking the earth's axis, the security team activated the manual.

'What is that...?'

If Shirone's eyes were correct, it was a weapon called Arc used by Mecha believers.

"Don't lie down!"

Justin, who was the only one watching the mountain, moved first when he saw the steel ball.

He pushed all the participants with both arms and fell under the stage, but Rangida, who was in the center, could not avoid it.

"What...?"

The explosive beads were already within 200 meters, and her mind was dizzy with the shelling that covered the sky.

"Miss Rangida!"

The man who pushed the security guard ran up to the stage and threw his body with Rangida in a tackle.

"Kyak!"

In her eyes falling backwards, hundreds of steel balls were spinning like whirlwinds.

'Is it a dream?'

When the brain, which sensed death, activated the seesaw of time, particles of light bubbled like soap bubbles in the middle of the landscape.

'Shi...ro...'

Light constructs Shirone faster than the speed of thought.

'...ne?'

The beads, which received strong resistance, began to emit red flames like popping corn.

'From the highest place possible!'

Numerous beads that soared into the sky like whirlwinds exploded at the same time.

"Uh! It's a terror!"

As the audience scattered in all directions at the sound of shaking the earth's axis, the security team activated the manual.

"Rangi, are you okay?"

When Shirone turned around, a pale Rangi unknowingly nodded.

"Justin! What about over there?"

Justin came up to the stage, rubbing his ears.

"Everyone is safe. But this is......"

Pony suddenly popped up.

"Shirone! Why are you here?"

"What about you? What about school?"

She, who had been choosing her words for a moment, lifted the corners of her mouth.

Justin shouted.

"They're coming!"

From the point where the sniper-like bombardment was carried out, nearly 200 people were running fast.

Pony, who had been pondering the answer until then, looked straight at Shirone with shining eyes.

"It's a tactical choice."

"Is that so?"

The corners of Shirone's mouth rose.

"You don't need to protect me, do you?"

Following Pony's hands, a rough stream of water sprang up and clumped together in the air.

"Are you saying?"

At the same time, Shirone cast a teleportation spell and went down under the stage, and the immortal community rushed in.

"Kill them! Kill all the pretty ones!"

'What the hell?'

Just looking at the mecha equipped with a piper, it was clear that they were new people, but the reason for the terror was too crude.

"They're terrorists! Execute them all on the spot!"

The security forces fought back, but the skills of the immortals were indeed one against a hundred.

"Hahaha! Pitiful earthlings!"

Those who had steel skeletal frames attached to their bodies jumped around like springs, and when they stomped their feet, the armor cracked.

'Probably a strength assist device......'

Pony, who had figured out the mechanism, pulled up the power of hydraulics, and at that moment, a sharp wind flew in.

"Aaaaaah!"

At the sound of a song from behind, Pony's concentration soared, and the water dragon, her specialty, caused a flood.

"Wow."

Rangi was stunned at the sight of the massive flow of water covering the blade wind and sweeping away even the mecha.

"What are you staring at? You're also from the military, right? Grab anything and get ready to fight."

Pony, who gave the order, looked back at Maya, who had cast a sound magic a while ago.

"Ah, there...... hello? Have you been well?"

"Tsk!"

The reunion with the person who directly dropped Pony in the graduation exam was not pleasant.

"Yeah. Let's vent our anger later and fight for now."

While some people came to their senses, most of the participants were paralyzed with fear.

"Kaaaak! Save me! What are the guards doing!"

"Take me away! Do you know who I am! Fight later and evacuate me first!"

Rangi, who thought it was a pity that the audience couldn't hear, approached Pony.

"They look really strong from what I see."

The security forces guarding the stage in two or three layers seemed to be pierced in no time.

"You knew Shirone, right?"

Rangi shrank his shoulders with a prickly expression.

"I think heaven helped. I don't know who among the three of us came to meet, but......"

Pony's prediction was wrong.

"At least we won't die here."

Where her gaze reached, Shirone was charging towards the leader of the enemies.

"What are you doing!"

The woman, whose face was covered with a cloth with the symbol of Mecca, flew into the sky and laughed.

"Hehehe! Why? Are you angry because you're bothering the pretty ones?"

'I'll finish it in one shot.'

The moment he loaded the photon cannon, Boridalma and Hye-ga simultaneously attacked from the left and right.

'Strong!'

Boridalma, who fell harder than gravity, punched straight.

"Wind and Rock Fist!"

The wind pressure, which was exactly like the shape of a fist, hit Shirone hard like iron.

'It's a fire spell.'

Shirone, who had the sphere of Yahweh in his palm, punched the wind from bottom to top.

"Be released."

With a bang, the Wind and Rock Fist was released and it seeped into the atmosphere.

"Huh?"

Boridalma's eyes popped out strangely.

'The Wind and Rock Fist is not released. But......"
