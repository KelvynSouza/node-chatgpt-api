[678] Sensation Occurs (2)

* * *

Brooks shouted at the medical staff.

"Hurry! We're running out of time!"

It was over if the golden time was exceeded in a state where the heart stopped.

"Oh, this……!"

The people who flew to Brooks' mansion, like a good mercenary broker, were experts in emergency and first aid.

Electric shocks were applied and CPR was endlessly carried out, but Venetia did not move.

"It's not working! She's already dead!"

"Save her! If this woman is gone, it's over!"

If Rufist safely completes the mission, Brooks gets the exclusive right to manage Radum.

The fastest way to stabilize Radum was to use Venetia, the leader of the spectrum.

"Even if she dies, keep going!"

It was a ridiculous sound, but the medical staff understood it like a rice cake and continued to shock the heart.

So 15 minutes passed, and the people who had turned green one by one spread out and fell on the spot.

"It's over. She's dead."

"Damn it!"

Brooks, who kicked the door enough to break the gong, could not control his excitement and walked around the room, making a fuss.

"Heeeek!"

Then Venetia's eyes opened wide and she inhaled air to the limit of her lungs.

"Venetia!"

Brooks ran, and the medical staff also forgot their fatigue and got up.

"How, how……."

The heart was beating again.

"She's alive! She's alive, Mr. Brooks!"

"Hahaha! That's what I said, right? I said it would work!"

The goal was divided into life and money, but the joy was the same.

"Wait, why is this woman like this?"

One of the medical staff approached Venetia with a serious expression.

The woman who had raised her upper body was staring straight ahead as if her soul had been lost.

"La Enemy……."

The tribe of Ain has three brains that recognize the past, present, and future, but the only brain alive in Venetia's head now was the prefrontal cortex that recognizes the past.

This was also a sensory ability of a completely different mechanism from the human brain.

Her gaze moved sideways following the footsteps where La Enemy had passed.

"I have to meet him."

Mumbling an unknown sound and getting up, a female medical staff put a coat on her bare upper body.

"Venetia! Where are you going?"

Since the brain that recognizes the present is dead, she could not analyze the current situation, and it was impossible to predict the future that she should never meet La Enemy.

Also, this was the reason why La Enemy came to find Venetia.

"To Radum."

The eyes of La Enemy, the vision of the Great Purification, followed La Enemy and moved their steps.

Rufist, who was waiting for Jane at the entrance of the bio, frowned when the power of the camouflage facility was cut off all at once.

'It feels cheap.'

There is no way that the ancient weapon capable of biological feedback has cut off power due to some kind of defect.

In the end, it was the judgment of the spectrum, and it was not a good intention for the human side.

'You're concentrating power.'

Looking at the size of the bio, if it's maximum output, it falls within the range of Wangseongdo.

From the beginning of managing Radum, we set the limit of the interception radius, but if La Enemy is directly involved, it is a situation that can be easily released.

'Now is the Great Purification. I was born 19 years ago and let my guard down.'

If La Enemy dominates the events of the past, finding the release code is easy.

Rufist infiltrated the bio without waiting for his party.

'Please solve it, Jane.'

All he could hope for was that she would take control of the bio in time.

* * *

Every time dozens of quick swords were stuck, a terrible scream of the Ain tribe burst out.

All the members belonging to the lower organization of the spectrum were attacking Shagal, and the Ethella party just watched with a lost soul.

"That's not a human. It's a ghost."

Even Yordic, a war fanatic, was trembling at the slaughter.

"Ahhhh!"

The screams gradually got closer to them, and finally, Shagal revealed himself through the crowd.

"Huuuuu!"

His face was crumpled like a hieroglyph of slaughter, and madness was flickering like oil in his eyes, where the whites were exposed.

'I will kill! Eliminate all life!'

When doubt disappeared in front of a clear goal, Schema showed its best function and strengthened the body.

"Stop! Listen to me!"

When Etela shouted, Shagal's face twisted even more.

'Tia!'

Why did she have to die?

'Don't think about anything! When all life disappears...!'

There's nothing to think about.

"Die!"

When the omnipotence of the rapid-fire sword surpassed the battle and reached the level of disaster, they attacked Shagal regardless of race.

As if born to annihilate life, those who entered his radius fell in an instant with holes in their bodies.

'Trapezius! Clavicle! Deltoid!'

"Kuaaak!"

When the blade was embedded along the left neck of the goblin, blood spurted out of the shell of the rapid-fire sword.

'Sternal! Pectoralis major! External oblique! Rectus abdominis!'

"Kueeek!"

The blood head, whose blade was embedded in the torso, screamed.

'Quadriceps femoris! Soleus! Medial gastrocnemius!'

"Ummmm!"

When the single-edged sword, which descended diagonally along the thick thighs of Tubo, started from the groin and went up the center of the body again, it attacked the main organs.

'Bladder! Kidney! Stomach! Lung! Heart!'

-The point is to stab quickly.

"Shut up!"

When Shagal, who smelled the scent of the incident, flew out of his seat and aimed at Evian, the single-edged sword of the rapid-fire sword trembled without advancing any further in front of Evian's raised eyes.

'What?'

The handle of the rapid-fire sword was metal.

"Now! Quickly...!"

Before Evian's words were over, Shagal's kick hit the side.

"Ugh!"

Before he knew it, the single-edged sword of the rapid-fire sword was stuck in both feet.

If he teleports again like this, his ankles will fly away, but it was better than dying.

"Ahhhh!"

As he tore off his ankle and rolled on the floor, what Evian saw was a single-edged sword pouring like rain.

"Idiot! Avoid it!"

Yordic swung the whip made of ice globes, but seven shells were already embedded in Arkman's heart.

'Jeez! Where is it!'

Yordic, who detected Shagal's movement through the spirit zone, was only a cognitive area.

It took a tremendous amount of time for the nerves to derive a logical reaction, and Shagal took advantage of that gap.

"Uh, ahhhh!"

Yordic, who gave up thinking and swung his whip indiscriminately, didn't feel caught.

Pick.

The sound of flesh being pierced was as clean as a bird's sound.

"Cough...!"

When the shell of a single-edged sword was embedded in Yordic's neck, Shagal flew like a flight when Yordic's body swayed sideways like a crab.

"Ahhhh!"

Blood was sprayed by pressure.

'We're all going to die like this!'

Etela attacked from the square, but Shagal, who smelled the scent of the incident, immediately left his seat and aimed at Evian.

"Hup!"

In front of Evian's raised eyes, Shagal's single-edged sword trembled without advancing any further.

'What?'

The handle of the rapid-fire sword was metal.

"Now! Quickly...!"

Before Evian's words were over, Shagal's kick hit the side.

"Ugh!"

Even though all the ribs were broken, if the magnetic force was released, the dagger would pierce in.

"Hmm."

Shagal, who landed on the ground by turning his body, grabbed Evian's back of the head and pushed it towards the dagger.

The blade was stuck in the forehead with a thud.

"Master!"

When Elwi cast a spell, a powerful poison gas spread.

It was the only revenge she could do at the point where all the masters of the three major guilds died.

"Hoo!"

Etelra, who had been holding her breath for nearly 5 minutes, slowly exhaled as the thick smoke cleared.

"Uh! Uh!"

Shagal, who was hugging Elwi from behind, was sitting against the wall, blocking her mouth.

No matter how powerful the gas is, it will not blow back to the caster.

At first, he thrust the blade, but even then, he did not cancel the magic, so he blocked his nose and mouth.

Etelra, who looked at Elwi, who was crying in fear, said.

"Wait. I have something to say to you...."

"Uh! Uh!"

Shagal, looking only at Etelra, stabbed Elwi's upper body with a dagger.

Thump, thump, thump, thump. Thump, thump, thump, thump.

It was a mechanical repetition as if stamping a seal as a joke, and every time the blade was stabbed, Elwi's body twisted as if it was electrocuted.

Finally, when life went out, Etelra closed her eyes and mourned.

'Wherever he goes, there are only corpses left.'

More than 100 bodies, including humans and Ain species, were scattered, and blood was flowing as if it had rained.

'But why did the master...'

Did he give his life to him willingly?

"Do you hate me?"

Shagal asked.

"If you hate me, come at me."

When the tremor disappeared from Elwi, Shagal, holding the only remaining dagger, stood up.

"You are strong. More than me."

Etelra admitted honestly.

"But if you were just evil, you wouldn't have been able to kill my master, Archbishop Raphael."

"I am evil."

Shagal couldn't forget Raphael.

"Was he your disciple? Your master died by my hand. Take revenge."

"I looked into you. And I found out why my master willingly gave himself to you."

"Hypocrisy."

The corner of Shagal's mouth rose bitterly.

"If you want to wrap it up like that, as much as you want...."

"The organization called 'Leaf Circus' never existed in the world."

"What?"

In order to accept the will that Raphael conveyed through death, Etelra, who wanted to crush Shagal right away, endured the desire to crush Shagal with a superhuman will of good.

"Your whole life was fake. It was just a brain in a vat."

Shirone, who was searching the vicinity by jumping over the buildings of Radum, said.

"Let's split up, Lian."

Because time was urgent, Lian agreed.

"Then I'll take this side. You go the other way. See you at the entrance of Life."

"Yeah. Be careful."

Lian, who seemed to worry about everything, smiled and flew.

'I can't die even if I want to.'

Lian, who jumped down under the building, started running at full speed from then on and carefully searched the surroundings.

There are traces of the ground that are unique to the ground.

'There.'

Following the corpses of the Ain species, Lian stopped at the place he arrived.

Wig of the storm.

He was dead with his waist cut off.

The perplexity that he didn't even know how he was cut off was conveyed as it was from the face that contained the emotions of the moment of death.

'It's not an injury during a fight.'

The right arm was missing from the elbow as if it had been forcibly torn off.

Thump, thump, when Lian raised his head at the creepy sound, a goblin with red glasses wrapped in a red cloak was tearing the flesh off Wig's arm.

When Lian confirmed that the flesh was passing through the jaw, he aimed the great sword.

"Come down. I'll cut you into pieces."

"If I argue...."

The goblin, brushing his teeth with his tongue, said, "This guy hunted me first." Wig's arm trembled. "Kill me, make money, and buy food with that money. What would be different?" The goblin eating Wig's flesh was the leader of Speedkiller, Kido of Eating. He was the one who corresponded to the taste of the great purification device.
