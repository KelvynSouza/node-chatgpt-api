[782] Definition of Evil (4)

* * *

A letter with Kashan's seal arrived in Torumia via the fastest route from Redline.

It was a registered mail delivered directly to the head of the Thunderbolt, and Albino left his seat as soon as he read the letter.

"Knock knock."

When there was no answer to the knock made with his mouth, Albino opened the door and entered the room.

"When someone comes, look at them."

Iruki, whose eyes were dull between the pile of documents piled up on the desk, raised his face.

"If you're a person, look at my condition."

Albino approached.

"Seeing a madman talking nonsense, it seems you haven't gone mad yet."

"……What's the matter?"

Iruki blatantly showed a bored face.

"Congratulations. Now you don't have to be tormented by chores."

When Albino threw the letter, Iruki looked down and confirmed Kashan's seal.

"What is this?"

"A scout offer has come from Kashan. Go to the Holy War. If you're okay, the kingdom is also thinking of actively supporting."

Iruki lost interest.

"I'm done. What's the Holy War when I can't even get a position here? Anyway, useless things……."

The son who didn't want to break the line of Merkodain, who had been the head of the Thunderbolt for generations, was proud.

"You hated Thunderbolt."

"Do you not go to the bathroom because you hate pooping?"

Albino kept his cool and took in the sight of his son engrossed in his work.

'Yes, Merkodain is just homework for you.'

This decided it.

"Don't do that and read the letter. The conditions are quite good, and you'll like it too."

When Albino tapped the table where the envelope was placed, Iruki stopped working and frowned.

"I said I'm not interested. I'm busy now, so go home and……."

"It's a letter written by Shirone."

Iruki, who snatched the envelope, took out the letter paper.

"……."

He read the letter as fast as his pupils moved, then turned back to the first page and savored each sentence.

"Hoo!"

He, who had entered all the contents into his head, exhaled heavily and rubbed his face with both hands.

Albino, who knew what his son was thinking, spoke with a warm smile.

"Go. The world wants you. The times are confusing, but I can protect Torumia."

Iruki said nothing.

"You have a talent that others don't have. But that talent is also just a miracle of probability that all mankind has rolled the dice. Don't think it's yours because it came to you. Use it for the world."

"……I'll go."

The eyes of Iruki, who made the decision, were firm.

"The fastest way to get to the Red Line International Station. When you arrive in Molton, Kashan will open a military channel for you."

All countries under the Red Line have magic circle facilities that can jump to other countries in the association.

"When does Bashuka open?"

"In 57 minutes. If you miss this, you have to wait 12 hours. I'll step on the procedure, so go to the Magic Association now."

However, considering diplomatic issues and many other things, the opening time of the magic circle is limited by international law.

'You don't have to wait in Molton…….'

From Molton, a border country of Kashan, you could jump directly to Kashan using the empire's military channel.

"It's going to take quite a while, right?"

Considering the delay of each country's station, you had to wait about an average of 6 hours per country.

"Eat and sleep on the way. Don't forget to exchange for international currency. If you have a good girl, go all in. Do you know? In another planet, no, in another country, will your face eat?"

It wasn't worth replying.

"I'll meet Nade and leave right away. Please take good care of me even if I'm not there. After all, he's a guy who's going to blow up one room, so it won't hurt the kingdom to keep him."

Nade, who returned to Torumia with Liz, was researching ancient weapons with the authority of Thunderbolt.

"……Do that."

Albino couldn't joke as he watched his son, who was leaving for the outside world.

Iruki, who packed his luggage in a briefcase, headed straight for the annex where Nade was staying.

"Nade, I'm going in."

The documents containing information about the kingdom's top-secret ancient weapons were scattered on the floor.

Nade was sitting, smoking a cigarette, at a dizzying table with empty liquor bottles and half-filled coffee cups.

"That's a good thing to do."

Nade was almost a wreck.

"What's going on? Isn't it work time now?"

Iruki, who picked up a rolling liquor bottle with his foot and put it in the trash can, asked.

"Do you come up with good ideas when you drink?"

Nade, who was scribbling letters on paper, sucked on a cigarette and tapped his temples.

"It relaxes the tension. You need to relax the tension that you must accomplish to think creatively."

"Then what about coffee?"

"It wakes up the tired brain."

"Then what about cigarettes?"

"It constricts the blood vessels in the brain to speed up blood flow. You can think more in the same amount of time."

It was the three miracles of creation.

"You're going to die like that."

"I can still hold on. Because I'm young. It's all about choice and focus. I'll quit everything once this is resolved."

Nade currently needed 120 percent.

"What's the matter, anyway?"

Nade, who was immersed in the conversation, raised his head and looked at Iruki.

"Outdoor clothes? Where are you going?"

Iruki took out a letter.

"Shirone called me. It seems she needs help. I'm going to Kashan. I won't be able to come back for a while."

"Shirone?"

Nade stood up abruptly, leaning on the table.

"Me? Did she call me too?"

Iruki pretended to read the letter.

"It says you're not needed. Just like you, just take a plate and get water in your nose......"

"Don't joke around."

Nade snatched the letter and read it.

"Hmm, that's right, isn't it?"

Nade's eyes, which had been dull with fatigue, regained their clear focus.

"Anyway, I'm sorry."

"Huh! Don't be sorry. Go and help Shirone. I have my own work to do."

Nade, who returned to the table, wrote down his inspiration in a scribbled handwriting.

"Watch, what I'm going to do in this war. I'm going to make a fortune and smash the guys who made Shirone cry."

If there's no money, there's no war.

'Hang in there. You can do it.'

Iruki believed in the potential of Nade, who had been a pure engineer, to become a technician with money as a goal.

"I'll contact you."

Nade raised his hand without saying a word, and Iruki slowly closed the door and left the room.

"We've arrived."

Shirone, who had been aimlessly walking around Aganos' spacious room, jumped at the manager's words.

'He's here! He's here!'

When they arrived at the inner city gate, people playing card games with Minerva, and Uorin were out.

There was no need for the empress of the empire to come out to meet them, but Uorin was just in a good mood.

'Because he's a friend of Shirone.'

Getting to know the friend of a loved one is as enjoyable as getting to know the loved one.

"Open the inner city gate."

When Iruki revealed himself through the opening of the huge gate, Minerva raised one eyebrow.

"Is that kid Iruki?"

The servant that Shirone praised until her mouth was dry.

'He's definitely not an ordinary appearance.'

With light brown hair and freckled eyes, his body was skinny and his coat was bigger than his physique, so the sleeves were flapping.

People who imagined him to look like Sein looked at him with a strange expression as Iruki raised his hand.

"It's been a long time, Shirone."

When there was no answer, Minerva turned around and Shirone was crying.

"Iruki......"

He's on the same side.

He was a friend who would never change and protect her side, no matter what future unfolded.

"Iruki......ii......"

Shirone ended up crying out loud.

"Is that so?"

Minerva looked back at Iluki again.

"A person who is okay even if they show a weak side."

Even Garcia admired the spirit of the infinite magician, which seemed unshakable in any situation.

She had no choice but to acknowledge Iluki when she saw such a Shiro falling apart in just one second.

"Why are you crying?"

Iluki, who put his briefcase on the floor, came up with a smile and hugged Shiro.

"Was it hard? You've worked hard."

It was enough consolation, and Shiro, whose words were blocked, just nodded repeatedly.

Woorin came up with a smile.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Teraje Woorin, the female emperor of Kasha."

"Thank you for calling me. I'm Iluki, a friend of Shiro."

Even in front of the top of the Three Emperors, Iluki looked straight into his eyes and asked for a handshake.

"Mitochondrial Eve. Is this the look of the one who contains history? You've done well against such a woman, Shiro."

Woorin also figured it out at a glance.

"A great strong heart. It's really different even though it's a friend."

As they exchanged glances thinking that each other would not be easy, Shiro spoke brightly.

"Iluki is a researcher affiliated with the Thunderbolt of the Torumia Kingdom."

Woorin smiled as if he had accepted it.

"Of course I know. Thank you for responding to a difficult request even though it must have been a hard journey."

"Whether it's difficult or easy, I'll have to hear it. Please prepare a seat first. I want to start quickly."

Although the anger had not yet subsided, the color finally returned to the eyes of the people playing cards.

"Okay. Gando will guide you."

The place they arrived at was a panic room.

It was narrow, but it was good for sharing secrets, and the people who met for the first time briefly introduced themselves.

As soon as the greetings were over, Woorin proceeded with the meeting.

"As Shiro wrote in the letter, it would be helpful to hear it directly."

The situation of the war, the concept of extreme evil, and the explanation of Exmachina and "Law Killing" continued.

"Hmm, a weapon that changes the law."

As expected, Iluki, who was a servant, showed the most interest in the ancient weapon Exmachina.

Gudio said.

"It's hard to say this after calling you, but it's uncertain how well you can handle Exmachina. We need to test it. We also need to check teamwork."

Ignoring Iluki was not the case, but it required the world's strongest brain to handle Exmachina.

"If you fail, you may have to go back. It's not a problem who recommended it."

"Of course. I'm fine anytime."

Ness pointed out the core.

"Also, please keep the story about Exmachina you heard today until the end of the war."

If Iluki, who failed the test, leaked information to his country, all strategies were bubbles.

"......Yes."

It was a problem that could be unpleasant from Iluki's point of view, but he obediently nodded.

"In the same context, we can't provide information about the Alpha Pisces and Beta Pisces we're looking for. The summary is up to here. Then let's go to Exmachina now."

"I don't mind that either. But......"

The people playing cards were about to leave their seats and looked back at Iluki.

"Alpha Pisces and Beta Pisces. I don't know who they are, but I think I know who they are looking for."

Agaya asked.

"Why do you specifically conclude that it's a person? To kill Habits, you need a lot of laws?"

"Because no matter how you change the law, the one who defines good and evil is human."

Gudio, who made eye contact with Ness, asked.

"So...... Who do you think we're looking for?"

"Two emotions that cause ripples in the purity of chaos."

Iluki spread his index and middle fingers.

"The one who loves Habits the most and the one who hates Habits the most. These two people are absolutely necessary for the 'Law Killing' to succeed."

"......"

At the exposure of the core strategy, the people playing cards closed their mouths without affirming or denying.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
