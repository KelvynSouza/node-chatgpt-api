[621] Scout Reporting (2)

-Once you go back to school...

On the day when the training of the Sibulsangpokmae ended, Miro explained the operation.

"You have to refuse the evaluation."

"Refuse the evaluation?"

"It's too late to catch up with the score difference of the graduation class. You will only instill a bad prejudice in the scouts. Instead, you should give up the evaluation and bet on the graduation test."

It was a correct diagnosis even when Shiro-ne thought about it.

"But graduation alone should not be a ground task."

Miro put strength in his voice.

"Even if you graduate, there aren't many associations that would willingly embrace a time bomb that could explode at any time. If you want to become a wizard, you have to show them that you have enough value for them to take the risk."

The strategy Miro demanded was one.

"When you think of the graduation test as a long-distance race, you have to go at full speed from the start. Then...."

Miro pointed to the destination and said.

"You have to finish at that speed."

-Entering the 5th stage of extreme survival.

When a little fatigue appeared on the faces of the participants, a 6-tier creature was summoned.

"There will be a lot of dropouts from now on."

Even the pros of summoning magic, worthy of the tier they use in actual battles, turned pale when they saw the lineup of monsters.

Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr^1^

"Did it exceed the expectations of the association?"

Lara asked as Baikal seemed to hesitate.

"Evaluator, your overall assessment is......"

"F."

Elizabeth demanded an explanation by twitching her body.

"The 29 participants are already out of my mind. They don't have a proper grasp of reality."

"But Shirone's ability score is definitely......"

"I know. I'm disappointed in the strategy set by number 27. With the current score, it could compete up to level 6, or even level 7. But that's the end."

Baikal shook his head as he finished speaking.

"The scouts remember everything about the test, down to the creature's score. Even if it's only tier 3, it won't bite with that. If 15 are selected before the end, the current power is just a show. F."

"......Understood."

Lara's pen engraved the letter F on Shirone's page.

"I know."

If Shirone had heard Baikal's explanation, he would have nodded.

"I know."

It's not a strategy set with a clear possibility of success in mind.

He knew that the only possibility left for him was to start running and keep broadcasting until the end.

"I will never stop!"

Shirone's photon cannon rained down like a shower, breaking Cerberus's spine.

"It's troublesome if you come out like this."

Prings, who had been robbed of the lead role, cast an ice spell, and sharp ice spikes divided the colosseum.

Taking advantage of the gap, Aima sniped the enemies around her.

"87. 88."

Elizabeth was watching.

"The rate of fire is 67 rounds per minute. Considering the sniper mode, it's an amazing speed."

"The accuracy seems a bit off. How many shots missed?"

Elizabeth, who was connected to the 2000 core system, looked at the exact figures.

"The current accuracy is...... 89.4 percent."

It was excellent compared to the graduation class, but it did not meet Baikal's standards.

"Hong An!"

Amy, who had backed up her self-field memory, began to shoot more precisely, and the bugbears were burned by the fire one after another.

"It's going up. 90.2 percent. 91.6 percent."

"If it's Carmis, it should be that much. For now, B."

Baikal finished his cold evaluation and his gaze moved to the next participant.

"Atomic Bomb!"

Iruki's detached spirit zone flew quickly, causing explosions on the faces of the monsters.

"It looks like a detonator."

Puff puff puff!

It was as if an invisible iron rod was blowing up the monster's head.

"In fact, it's a fairly high-level explosive equation. And it's accurate. For servant number 5, the shape of objects is perceived as a fractal structure. It's mathematical, so there's no error."

Baikal carefully watched Iruki's movement.

"The neural response speed is 0.024 seconds, which is the top among the current participants."

"Hmm."

Lara's note was marked with 'Hmm', and then the pen stood upright.

"A little...... Isn't intuition lacking? Being accurate doesn't mean it's efficient. The response method is too mechanical."

"It seems to focus more on blocking variables than increasing efficiency. Nevertheless, the annihilation speed is above average."

"For now, B."

Lara recorded it, but Elizabeth pouted her lips.

"Isn't the standard too high? Even if the level of the participants is high, it can be considered as having no disadvantages at this point."

"Not having a disadvantage doesn't mean having an advantage. For example, if it was Flura, I would have made a different judgment."

Comparing with the valedictorian of the Royal Magic School itself meant that the standard was high.

"It's a mess."

"Woah!"

The Screamer, who cast a shotgun movement, punched a bugbear.

"He's obsessed with his own power and his thinking is paralyzed."

"Maya! Don't fall behind me!"

Kaiden rotated around Maya and cut down Cerberus with his sword.

"Forgetting the mission and obsessing over beliefs."

Shirone's photon cannon stretched out, making the werewolf's back bend.

"Throw away tactics and focus on firepower."

Now even Elizabeth kept her mouth shut.

"There are cases like this. The stats are significantly higher than other schools, but the mental state is not normal. What do they think the test is? They're doing whatever they want, aren't they?"

Even some perverted personality should act like a magician in front of a mission. That was the talent the kingdom wanted.

"According to the Red Line regulations, graduates have the first negotiation rights in their national association."

If the first negotiation fails due to treatment, compensation, or other issues, then other countries can offer scouting.

"The standard is important to them, not to us. What we have to do is find the most competent person and report it to the association."

"......I understand."

Baikal had no choice but to accept his opinion.

"But some are quite useful."

Fermi's various magics were adding firepower in the right places, and Dante was also freely cooking enemies using instant magic circles.

Also, Pring's ice magic was sharp enough to be called a masterpiece.

"Number 1. Number 2. Number 22. Grade A."

As all the participants' actions were graded, the time for 5th stage annihilation was almost over.

'One minute left.'

In a situation where the number of monsters still exceeded two hundred, Shirone's mind became anxious.

'58 seconds. 57 seconds.'

If it continues like this, the 6th stage creature will be summoned to the Colosseum without even a 30-second mental recovery time.

'I must finish it!'

For Shirone, who had raised firepower from the beginning, those 30 seconds were so desperate.

Puff puff puff puff bang!

The scattering photon cannon hit the monsters all around.

A bugbear with a broken shoulder, a Cerberus with a head flying off, a gargoyle with cracked skin, all the enemies started rushing towards Shirone.

"Kuuuuu!"

Shirone, trying to regain her tired mind, fired more photon cannons, but the number of rushing enemies was increasing.

"......Did you make a mistake?"

Elizabeth asked.

"He's been firing magic with that power for almost 10 minutes. His mind is bound to be disturbed."

Even if he wasn't a scout, anyone could feel that Shirone's accuracy was falling.

"Isn't that dangerous?"

At Reyna's words, Ollina shed tears again.

"You're so insensitive. If you don't know, just watch."

Reyna, who heard Lian's nagging, comforted Ollina's shoulder and spoke unfairly.

"But even I can see that he's noticeably tired."

Lian bit her lip and turned her eyes to the Colosseum.

'Shironeâ€¦â€¦.'

Only those who have felt the number of 100 in their bodies can know how many entities it means.

"It's okay. There won't be a problem."

"Really?"

Now even Reyna relied on her sister's judgment.

"If he died, he diedâ€¦â€¦."

Lian's voice was firm.

"He's not the type to get disturbed because he's tired."

'Now!'

Shirone, who had drawn in numerous monsters, gritted his teeth and focused his mind.

'Elysion!'

Raising concentration again at the end of a 10-minute sprint consumed much more mental power than usual, but it wasn't a bad deal if he could only succeed in annihilation.

'30 seconds. I can recover in 30 seconds!'

With that thought, his multi-explosive magic was cast.

Kwakwakwakwakwakwang!

"Oh myâ€¦â€¦."

The spectacle of seven 10-meter diameter explosions overlapping and exploding took the souls of the audience, and the monsters trapped in the wave of mass flew back and forth between the spheres of light.

'9 seconds! 8 seconds!'

With 7 seconds left, the creatures dominated by multiple explosions were again decomposed into minimum pixels and disappeared.

"That's it! I told you!"

When Lian raised her arms and shouted, Ollina shrugged her shoulders.

'1 minute. 1 minute and I can recover!'

With that thought, his multi-explosive magic was cast.

Kwakwakwakwakwakwang!

"Oh myâ€¦â€¦."

The spectacle of seven 10-meter diameter explosions overlapping and exploding took the souls of the audience, and the monsters trapped in the wave of mass flew back and forth between the spheres of light.

'9 seconds! 8 seconds!'

With 7 seconds left, the creatures dominated by multiple explosions were again decomposed into minimum pixels and disappeared.

"That's it! I told you!"

When Lian raised her arms and shouted, Ollina shrugged her shoulders.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
