Murder of the Law (2)

Gustav's Imperial Palace Marsak was crowded with women who came to become imperial maids.

'How can this be...

Even as Habits' notoriety spread around the world, over 300 people applied.

"Do you know what kind of person His Majesty the Emperor is?"

She asked a woman with a sharp chin and cold face waiting in the left column.

"Heh, you're the same. I wish we both kept our mouths shut. We're competitors from now on."

'I'm not...

Unlike other candidates, Abella came to kill Habits.

"Is it because of money?"

The woman looked back coldly.

"What else would it be? Regardless of origin, the pay is unspeakable and the employee benefits are excellent. Above all, it's about becoming a maid of the Imperial Palace."

The value of the common people is determined by the nobility, and the position of the maid of the Imperial Palace is not looked down upon by the nobility.

"But he's a tyrant, isn't he?"

Everyone looked at Abella, and the atmosphere on the scene froze like the North Pole.

"Hey, what did you just say?" The captain of the guard escorting the maid approached with a murderous look in his eyes.

'It's okay. I'll be fine.'

The most important part of Abella's project was to love Habits.

If the original value of Alphapis is lost, the law will be twisted, and then everything will be over.

"Say what you said earlier again. It would be good to pray to God that my ears are strange."

"Mr. Habits is a tyrant." The captain drew his sword at the disrespectful reply to the emperor.

"If you kill me, you will die too."

The blade stopped at the edge of Abella's neck.

"What do you mean?"

"I didn't come here to serve the emperor. I came to see Mr. Habits personally."

"You... know His Majesty the Emperor?"

"If you doubt it, you can report it to the top. Tell Mr. Habits that Abella has come." He didn't dare to do that.

'It's awkward.'

What's more, if her words were true, he should never be rude.

'Let's leave it to others. If you get involved, you die.'

The captain of the guard, who had sheathed his sword, spat out a word as he returned to his place.

"Be quiet. There is a procedure for everything."

It was a sign of backing off, and Abella stuck out her tongue at the captain's back.

A woman who had been watching the ridiculous event from a distance spoke with shocked eyes.

"You, are you crazy? Why would you lie like that?"

It was commendable that she was quick-witted as a maid candidate, but if the truth was revealed, it would be death on the spot.

"First of all, I have to live and see. And that captain won't be able to check, because he's a coward."

The woman laughed and reached out her hand.

"Let's greet each other formally. I'm Katenia from Manaka. I'm thirty-two years old. I'm your sister, right?"

"Yes. I'm Abella. I'm twenty-three years old."

After finishing the roll call, Katenia asked.

"But are you really bold? How can you easily spit out such an insult to the emperor?"

Honestly, I don't know.

'Mr. Habits.'

When I heard his deeds close to evil deeds, my teeth chattered, but in a corner of my heart....

- Uh, it's okay. It's okay.

When he stroked my back and said it was okay, it was the first time in my life that I felt like I had a fence.

"Well, it's true."

Abella shrugged her shoulders.

"Well... I'm scared, honestly. But I'm old, so I don't expect to go to the side room. Oh, I'm sorry."

Unlike Katenia, Abella was of age to go to Habits' bed.

"It's okay. I'm actually going to go to the side room."

"What?"

Even Katenia, who loved money, would have thought differently if she had to go to Habits' side.

"Group 4, enter!"

When the guard opened the gate, 30 people passed through the arch in a rush.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

No one wanted to take the reins of the murderer, and a cold silence flowed.

"It's not coercion. But anyway, in the end, it's going to be drawn by lottery. If you don't have confidence in passing...

"I'll do it."

Everyone's gaze gathered in one place, and Katenia stuttered with a ridiculous expression.

"You, you...

Abella shrugged her shoulders.

"I told you, it's something like this."

The manager quickly flipped through the ledger, checking the number on her name tag.

"Hmm, Yuse Abella. Gypsy origin...

There seemed to be no special abnormalities.

"Go to that door. If the maids do a re-examination and there is no special abnormality, it's a pass right away."

"Yes. But I have a favor to ask."

The manager lifted his chin as if it was a dying man's wish.

"Tell me."

"Perhaps His Majesty Habitz, or rather the Emperor, may remember me, can I give him a heads up in advance?"

"The Emperor?"

The manager, who had been looking around, said.

"You, are you mentally ill? If so, I can't let you pass. It's a matter of life and death."

"It's your life at stake, manager. If you leave me like this, you don't know what kind of trouble will come later."

'Oh my! Why is this happening to me...!' The manager, who felt the same emotion as the captain of the guard, frowned and asked.

"So what's the relationship with the Emperor?"

Abella, who had carefully observed the scene where the candidates were looking pale, smiled broadly.

"Childhood friend."

"Your Majesty! The manager asks for an audience."

The door of the Grand Hall opened, and an old woman over seventy walked across the Grand Hall with a dead expression.

Balkan, sitting on the throne, snored, and a military tactical map was spread out on the floor.

Habitz and the other four knights were sitting there, playing with dolls with military figures.

"Roar! Bang! Cannon bang!"

Comedian Zeta was startled.

"Uh-oh! My eyeball fell out! Put it back on quickly! Eyeball! Bring the eyeball!"

The combat doll Natasha moved the soldier's mouth.

"Die! Die! Die! Die!" The inner king, Sumodo, crumpled the map.

"The women of the Paris Kingdom are all mine! Well, even if you only pick out women in their 10s and 20s, it's about 4.47 million...

The manager coughed.

"Hmm, Your Majesty."

Habitz turned his head, mumbling in his sleep.

"Why? I'm busy now. It's a national meeting."

"Do you have a friend named Yuse Abella from a long time ago?"

"Who? Hmm."

If he lied, he could lose his neck, but the manager kept his mouth shut as if he were a clam.

'Die if you die.'

Don't imagine the future.

This was the first requirement for a manager of the Gustav Empire.

"I don't know."

The manager bowed his head.

"I understand. Then...

Balkan turned around and mumbled in his sleep.

"That, you know. A girl I met a long time ago. She said she was going to open a flower shop or something...

Habitz's eyes widened as he stood up.

"Yuse Abella!"

The four knights looked at him at the same time.

"Right! It was Abella! But why? Why are you looking for her all of a sudden?"

He had forgotten the name, but he had never forgotten the promise he made with the girl at the time.

"It's not me who's looking for her, but a girl who came in as a maid this time and wants to see you."

"Abella came to see me?" Habitz's shoulders trembled.

"She must have completed the flower garden!"

"Your Majesty! The manager asks for an audience."

The door of the Grand Hall opened, and an old woman over seventy walked across the Grand Hall with a dead expression.

Balkan, sitting on the throne, snored, and a military tactical map was spread out on the floor.

Habitz and the other four knights were sitting there, playing with dolls with military figures.

"Roar! Bang! Cannon bang!"
