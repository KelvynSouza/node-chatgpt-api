"Argo?"

No matter how closely I looked, the hologram in front of me was definitely Amy.

-What do you see?

"Well, that's......"

Argo nodded as if Shirone's answer wasn't important.

-Concentration of emotions is important for reincarnation. Although it's very rare, if the concentration weakens, there could be an error in the reincarnation program. The current appearance is the form that appears when your brain waves are most concentrated.

"Amy......"

I wanted to see her more than ever today.

-Remember it carefully. If there is an error in the reincarnation program, you may lose your memory in reality. It's hard to recover if you lose the code.

"I don't have amnesia."

-I know. Your brain waves aren't like that. You seem to have come from a different time. There are often such cases.

Argo seemed to know a lot, and even seemed to know everything.

"How can I get out of here?"

-You speak like a technician. Interesting. Will you follow me? I'll introduce you to this place.

Although he didn't meet the human he wanted, Shirone thought he could have a conversation with Argo, so he followed her into the elevator.

Just like the drone perfectly controlled gravity, the elevator didn't even have a small vibration or noise.

-The name of this world is Utopia. Originally, there were many names, but after the last remaining reincarnation denier died, the representatives of each country held a meeting and created it. Currently, about 16 billion people live in Utopia.

"Living?"

He thought he might be dead.

-Yes, everyone is alive. And it doesn't increase or decrease anymore. It seems that humans have chosen to live a new life here forever.

When the elevator arrived and the door opened, a huge space appeared around the circumference of the tower.

The ceiling was at the top of the tower, and along the cylindrical wall, many people were in the glass tube that they had seen from the outside.

It seemed to exceed 10,000 people.

Shirone, who was lost in the majestic scale and looked up, asked Argo.

"What is this... what kind of world is this?"

-It's the same world. I don't know what kind of world you lived in, but it won't be different. It just converges endlessly.

When Argo raised her hand, a large hologram turned on at a height of 3 meters, and many images passed by.

-Prototype Argo. The first complete synchronization simulation program. It connects to human brain waves and allows you to experience a completely different world.

The image of the large hologram changed and the life of a young man passed quickly.

"So, are you saying that the people who are asleep here go into the glass tube and live in a completely different world?"

-Yes. When Argo was first serviced, it was nothing more than a commercial entertainment product. Virtual has a limit. The thought that you can always go back lowers the reality.

Only being trapped is real.

-So, mankind made a tremendous resolution. They closed the world so that they couldn't know that the Argo program was a simulation.

"The world... closed?"

-It wasn't easy. There is a big technical difference between providing virtual and making it really believe. Plus, stability and ethical problems......

Argo skipped unnecessary information.

-Anyway, Utopia solved the problem of eternal life, which was a homework for mankind. They completed the final program, Argo.

When Shirone found a shadow and looked up, a huge iron ball was floating with a mechanical lens attached.

It didn't feel small, but the huge pupil definitely resembled something.

"Anke Ra?"

Amy's hologram put one hand on her stomach and bowed politely.

-Let me introduce myself formally. I am Argo, the reincarnation manager of Utopia, the Akashic Record.

Shirone had met Digital Ra in the Apocalypse, but there was no memory because it was a place where the debris of information gathered.

"I have no idea what you're talking about."

-Let me introduce you to Utopia. There's an extra seat. If you want reincarnation, I'll help you.

When Argo raised his head, two drones flew in and faced each other in front of him.

Electricity flowed from the eyes of the hologram Amy, and the two drones communicated in their language.

-Zzz! Zzzzzz! Zzz! Zzzzzz!

As the eerie sound of electromagnetic waves ended, screens reflecting each person's life appeared in front of more than 10,000 glass tubes.

Feeling her fingertips trembling, Shirone looked around the screens with a pale face.

-Argo is an eternal life program. For humanity to live forever, I must also be immortal. An artificial intelligence capable of self-system recovery. So even if I reset, I do not disappear.

"Reset?"

-There is no perfect system. Sometimes initialization is necessary. It's a virtual world, but there is a specific intention. If the world does not flow as intended, reset and retry. In other words, it is to develop the eternal life program again in Argo's world. It's about living forever through public fear.

Shirone felt fear for the first time.

-Another problem is that someone opens a closed world. It is classified as the most serious error. In that case, reset or erase the entity.

"Erase?"

Gepin's erasure came to mind.

-It means removing specific information. But in that case, the system gets confused, so unless the conditions are met, I don't have the authority to erase.

Even if it's virtual, if Argo arbitrarily erases information in the world, it's a problem.

-In Utopia, Argo manages reincarnation, but it is also linked to the world that humans dream of. However, even I do not realize that I am virtual there. No one should know. It must be a confined world.

The 9999th world was completely different from the world where Shirone lived, but she thought it might be.

"Do you live like that? Without ever thinking it's fake, thinking it's real?"

Argo brought a screen reflecting someone's life in front of Shirone's eyes.

-The mediator between Argo and human signals is a photon. Of course, biological signals use electricity, and precision systems use quantum transmission, but the basis is always light. It's so sophisticated that you can never think it's fake.

Argo said, looking around the screen.

-The time of the virtual world is based on the speed of light, so no matter can be faster than light. Also, because it is a basic medium, the speed of light is always constant.

It was the law of constant light speed.

-If you perceive at the speed of light, time stops, but that is allowed within the normal range. However, if it gets faster than light, time is disturbed in the system. If a time paradox occurs, it will be overloaded. It's a serious problem.

Shirone was watching the life of a soldier fighting on the battlefield through the screen.

He was screaming in serious injury.

"Did you want this life?"

-No. Of course, it's not impossible to set life artificially, but it's prohibited by law. He's a soldier on the screen, but the person who's actually dreaming is a woman. The system determines what kind of existence you will be born into in the next reincarnation. It's based on Karl.

"Karl?"

-It means the degree of violation of causality. The lower the car, the easier it is for the system to predict, and the higher the car, the harder it is to predict. Usually, you increase your car by going through reincarnation, but you don't set it to exceed 90 percent. Because it threatens the system.

The soldier on the screen was dying from an arrow.

"What happens when you die?"

-You wake up from a dream. When you come out of the capsule, the drone performs a precision inspection. You can rest in Utopia for a few days, or you can reincarnate again.

"But you don't know until you die, right? The stress must be huge, aren't there any side effects?"

-You can't say there aren't any.

Argo readily admitted it.

- It was the biggest hurdle of the Utopia project. It's good to have a closed world, but no one wants to experience the fear of death. So, representatives from each country develop a very efficient program.

"What kind of program?"

- God.

Amy's hologram raised her index finger.

- The introduction of the God program significantly improved the stability of the system. The concept of not being the end reduced the stress index by more than 90%. Therefore, in Argo, entities above a certain car are set to build a god.

The screen of the soldier praying to God was shown, and suddenly there was noise.

"What is this?"

The screen continued endlessly, rushing through a brilliant tunnel of light in the first person perspective.

- It's an ambassador experience program. It's an electromagnetic tunnel that occurs during the process of updating to reality after the end of life's turn. Here, we recover the memories of reality. Sometimes there are variables during loading and they go back, but the God program absorbs the error.

Argo's lens tightened and then spread out.

- Fortunately, it was transmitted safely. Taking care of people who have returned to reality is also the role of the administrator.

The screen changed to the background of Utopia, and a glass tube installed inside the building was shown.

"No!"

As soon as the lid opened, the blonde woman sat up abruptly.

It was a terrible death, but she sighed as she recalled the memories of reality.

"Ha, I'm annoyed. Why do you only pour arrows at me?"

It was a monotonous and futile feeling as if she had a nightmare for a lifetime.

A drone flew in front of her and opened the lens.

- Welcome to Utopia. Did you have a pleasant trip?

"I know."

As the woman who answered as if it was common got out of the capsule and moved her steps, the drone followed her.

- We will start a precision inspection. Do you need anything?

"Water. Sedative."

When the drone pulled out a hose from the body and put it in the woman's mouth, water was created in an instant.

Then, when it came down to the neck and made a pick sound and injected a sedative, the woman's shoulders twitched, but the reaction ended there.

While being inspected by the drone, the woman asked.

"When is the next reincarnation?"

- Car value 67%. There are 2,598 species that you can choose from the system.

"Can I be born as a human?"

- It is possible.

The woman stretched out and muttered.

"If it's 67%, it's still far away, isn't it? What is the record of the person who has gone the farthest among the people currently remaining?"

- Currently, it is Omega 876 years based on light power.

"Wow, it's really fast."

Shirone, who was watching the screen, asked Argo.

"Omega 876 years?"

It was the unit of time written in the record left by Gepin in Babel.

- Omega is a unit that divides the beginning and end of time into percentages. The core of the Utopia project is to continue digging into the simulation. When it reaches Omega 1,000 years, it enters the next simulation, so the frequency of coming out to reality decreases.

It means living forever without wasting even a few days in reality.

- As the simulation repeats, the time to reach Omega 1,000 years will shorten based on the time here.

Because it's a geometric series.

- 10 years, 5 years, 2 years, it keeps decreasing, and finally 1 second, 0.5 seconds……. Eventually, you will live forever in an instant.

Shirone couldn't believe it.

"But time is still going on here, right? After 100 years, they will eventually die."

- Of course. However, it is a future that will never come to the residents of Utopia. Because in the world of geometric series, time will be infinitely divided.

It was the secret of true immortality.
