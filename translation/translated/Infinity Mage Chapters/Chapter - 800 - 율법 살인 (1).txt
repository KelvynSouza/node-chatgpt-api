"Law Murder

"The winner of the Miss World contest is!"

When the news of the terrorist's capture spread, the competition was successfully held again.

"Miss Arachne! Varho Ranki!"

The crowd, which almost filled the audience, stood up and applauded, and Ranki shed tears of joy.

"Thank you! Thank you!"

She had tasted all the bitterness of the world to get here, so her tears were sincere now.

"Congratulations, Ranki."

It was also an honor for Shirone that Pony, the representative of Tormia, came in second.

'Well done, Pony.'

She, who had achieved her own results, was going to return to her hometown and devote herself to magic training again.

"Is it over now?"

Marsha and Justin approached Shirone, who was standing at the end of the audience.

The Justin Mercenary Corps had already left after merging with the Parrot Mercenary Corps, but Shirone wanted to check the results of the competition.

"Yes. We have to leave now." Marsha squinted and exhaled smoke.

"Are you going to do something strange again?"

Shirone responded with a smile, and as the applause subsided, Ranki spoke her thoughts.

"Thank you, everyone. First of all, I would like to thank the director of the Beauty Style Hair Shop who made me who I am now...

A competition official came looking for Shirone.

"Magician of the Ivory Tower, I should have told you in advance, but I didn't have a chance because of the terror...

He handed over the sheet music of 'Light Bee' signed by Maya.

"Ms. Maya asked me to deliver it directly. If you just give it, you'll know what it means...

Maya said she would stay until the end of the competition, but her agency would never allow it.

"I see."

Shirone nodded her head as she took in the lyrics filled with her heartfelt feelings.

"Yes, Maya is right. Thank you."

The reason she left only her heart without facing each other was her wish not to decide anything.

'We'll meet again.'

At a higher place than now.

"Let's go. You're busy?" After saying goodbye to Marsha, Shirone took Justin and left the capital.

The strange bird Kaidra, who was circling the sky, landed in front of them with a strange bird sound.

"Are you going to ride this?"

Justin's eyes widened.

"Yeah. I came on it when I came. It's Kaidra that the Empress of Kashan rides herself. The name is Latusa."

Latusa stroked Shirone's cheek with her beak.

'It's a 3-tier monster.'

The strongest monster that the Justin Mercenary Corps had caught so far was only 5 tiers.

Although it was overlooked because it was specialized in flight, it was a powerful creature that could crush any ordinary monster like a bug.

"Do you eat people?"

"Haha! Maybe?"

Since eating people doesn't mean eating Shirone, she hadn't checked.

Justin looked scared and Shirone, who had climbed on Kaidra, beckoned seductively.

"Is it your first time? Come on up."

In her eyes, Kaidra looked like a giant monster running with Shirone.

Ranki, who arrived at the hotel and packed her luggage, sat on the sofa and drank alcohol until the bodyguard came.

"Ha, it's over anyway."

The joy of winning was temporary, and the hardships of the past flashed through her mind like a slide show.

'Shirone.'

The afterimage of the strongest magician in the world remained at the end of the slide show.

Ranki, who was looking at the 'Dragon Slayer Grand Magician' left by Shirone, shook her head.

"Stupid, what are you thinking?"

The world they live in is different.

'It's not because you're strong or weak.'

What magicians pursue is not material but spirit, and Ranki could never understand them.

"Ms. Ranki, I brought Mr. Bunny."

"Come in."

A man with a crow's nest-like hair and a sparse beard entered with a stiff body.

"Re, really Ms. Ranki?"

At the sight of Ranki sitting on the sofa, Bunny trembled as if moved.

"Please sit down. I wanted to express my personal gratitude, so I asked you to come."

It was a lifetime honor for him to become a fan of Rangi from the World Beauty Contest Mania.

"Thank you! Thank you!"

Rangi smiled with her eyes.

"I should be the one thanking you. You saved me back then."

When the explosive bullets from Mecca flew into the mountain, he was the only one who ran onto the stage.

"Did I help?"

In reality, it was Shirone who prevented the terror, so Rangi leaned her upper body as he sat down with an awkward expression.

"I'm sorry, but I don't have much time. I have to go to the celebration performance."

"Haha! Yes, of course. It's enough for me to see Rangi up close."

"So if you have something to say, say it now."

"Yes?"

Rangi raised the corner of her mouth.

"Since you risked your life for me, I'll grant you a wish unofficially. You can ask for anything."

When he reached a thought that came to mind, Bernie swallowed his saliva.

"Really?"

"Do you think I called you to joke? Tell me."

"I might think it's strange, but if you really want me to make a wish, tonight...

Rangi nodded her head.

"Yes, tonight?"

Bernie closed his eyes and shouted.

"Please have dinner with me just once!"

"Your dinner... Yes?"

Rangi blinked her eyes.

"And, I'm really sorry, I know it's shameless, but it's my lifelong wish! Please just once... Bernie, who was hastily rummaging through his backpack, took out the optical camera he had bought with a lot of money.

"If you could take a proof shot...

Seeing Rangi's dumbfounded expression, he finished his sentence in a creeping voice.

"Is it not possible?"

Rangi had no choice but to ask back.

"What? Is that your real wish?"

Bernie was quite dejected.

"A proof shot... to show off to my friends...

"Haha, hahaha!"

Rangi, who was relieved, leaned against the sofa and looked up at the ceiling, bursting into laughter.

'So that's what it was.'

Magician.

They seemed to understand a little bit about their lives.

Hwangseong Aganos.

"If you want to know about someone, take the most humble attitude in front of that person."

Woorin said.

"People want to be superior, so they eventually reveal their true colors. But if that person doesn't change...

Gando answered.

"He's a trustworthy person."

"No. Keep being humble until that person shows his true self. It's a matter of who can endure longer. Some people easily consume emotions. It may seem a little superior to criticize and belittle others, but there's nothing left, right?"

Emotions disappear when revealed.

"The superiority of the heart is nothing but an illusion. The real superiority is visible."

Woorin spread his arms.

"Jewelry-decorated Hwangseong, the army stretching to the horizon, a huge amount of gold coins. All of these were things that could be obtained in reality because they gave up the superiority of the heart."

It must be the philosophy of the emperor.

"So don't sell your emotions cheaply. Hide yourself and use other people's thoughts. That's the whole game."

"I have a question."

Gando interrupted.

"If it's according to Your Majesty's theory, isn't it forbidden to divulge the emperor's technique to me now?"

"Sharp."

Woorin walked to the window.

"Gando, by any chance, do you want to be an emperor?"

Now I knew.

"Mother."

"It's a great era of purification. I have no more pawns left. The only person I chose in the unknown world is Shirone."

She doesn't plan to have a daughter.

"It's an extreme judgment."

"Because it's an extreme world. The soul money of Habitz is the natural enemy of the logic-based Teraje."

She walked to the window.

"Gando, by any chance, do you want to be an emperor?"

"There are ways to form alliances." From Gando's point of view, it wasn't bad for Kashan and Gusta P to divide the world.

"I can't give up Shirone."

"You've been running for a long time. If now is the only chance to bloom in Teraje's life...

Someday it must bloom, so it has endured eternity.

"Sir Shirone has arrived." When the guards outside announced, Uorin's face brightened like a girl.

"Let's go, Gando."

Looking at her back as she rushed towards the door, Gando took a deep breath.

'Emperor? Me?'

Gando was the son of Teraje, and it was true that he borrowed the womb, but the genes were not mixed.

'What are you looking at?' He couldn't understand her, who gave up the history of eternity to live with her loved one.

'It's not just moving with emotion. Maybe...

We may have already reached the end of the era.

"You've improved." Gustav's military Balkan looked down at dozens of chess pieces in front of him and said.

"Really? I don't even know the rules properly."

Habitz was not interested in chess, and just picked up the pieces and put them down.

'So it's strange.'

It seems to be placed at will, but the winning rate is almost 50% in the game with the genius military Balkan.

'It's not about reading the military. It's just fun to keep fighting.'

Because he is not obsessed with winning or losing, the winning rate is 50%.

'If you decide to win, no, that's not compatible with chaos either?'

Balkan asked.

"What is your philosophy of ruling people, Your Majesty?"

Habitz's imperial theory is.

"There's nothing like that. It's too simple. No matter how you classify apples, they're just apples."

"But aren't there people like strawberries and pears in the world? It's diverse."

"There's none."

Habitz raised his head.

"Everyone thinks they're the best. But if you lock them in a warehouse and beat them with a club for three days?"

Habitz groaned.

"Oh, I'm dying! Yes! I'm an apple! You're a god! I'm a dog!"

Balkan blinked his eyes.

"It's really strange. If you're really the best, you should be the best even if you're hit with a club or your guts are pulled out, but you always change your words."

"Hehe."

Habitz stroked his mustache.

"If that's the case, why do you think you're right in the first place? It must be a disease."

"Hahahaha!"

Balkan slapped his knee.

"Excellent insight, Your Majesty!"

It was an unusually hot summer.

The record heat wave was rampant, and the border between Kashan and Gustav was filled with the smell of blood.

"With this, all preparations are complete."

On the left of Uorin, the team of Irugi who controls Exmachina, and on the right, the team of Shirone who is in charge of "Law" were seated.

"This is the only chance to kill Habitz."

Minerva looked at Abella standing in the center.

'Abella and Justin, both are fully prepared, but the higher probability is rather Alpha Pisi.'

Abella and Justin did not meet once while staying in the Imperial Palace for half a year.

Considering their respective relationships, it was natural, but in reality, it was a strategic judgment.

"Yus Abella. Now the lives of many people depend on your hands. You know that, right?"

"Don't worry. I won't make a mistake."

Abella, who had repeated analysis and learning with top experts, could not find any tension on her face.

'Mr. Habitz, I'm going. To kill you.'

It was natural that the servants ran away and suffered from manpower famine because the emperor was violent.

"I will depart."

The first mission of Alpha Pisi was to enter Gustav Empire as a maid and capture Habitz.
