[641] Dead End (1)

Nade, who woke up in Liz's bed, frowned as he felt the hangover from last night.

'Liz Senpai…….'

As he turned his head in a dreamy memory, Liz was asleep with only her face out of the blanket.

'I should have drunk moderately.'

He should remember vividly!

"Hmm."

Nade, who found clothes scattered under the bed, opened his eyes reluctantly and slowly lifted the blanket.

"Stop. Back to the original position."

As the half-lifted blanket returned to its place, Liz stretched out with a smile.

"You're cheeky. Did you sleep well?"

"Hehe, I thought it would be cold, so I tried to cover you with a blanket. Wake up. We have to go for breakfast."

"Uh, I can't eat. I guess I drank too much yesterday."

Liz, who was squirming in the blanket, crawled over to Nade and put her lips on his stomach and made a sound.

"Uhaha! It tickles!"

"Let's go out a little later. Huh?"

Nade, who was lovingly looking at Liz's face, gradually lost his smile.

"Liz."

"Huh?"

"Won't you regret it?"

At Nade's serious question, Liz changed her expression and got up abruptly and wrapped herself in a blanket.

"Why do you say that? Do you regret it?"

"I'm not going to be a wizard. I don't have any savings. There will be a lot of difficulties in the future, can I really make you happy……."

Only then did Liz, who realized it, smile with a relieved expression.

"You're not making me happy. We're creating happiness together."

Nade, who had lived a life of responsibility all his life, didn't even know what happiness was.

"Let's swim together. I'll try hard too."

"Liz……."

As Nade looked at her with eyes soaked in emotion, Liz asked shyly with a smile.

"But are you really okay? If you graduate from magic school with second place grades, the future of a wizard wouldn't be bad."

Nade shook his head.

"My limit is here. That's why Iruki decided to go into Yongrye. If I was satisfied, I couldn't go any further."

"Is that so? It doesn't matter if you don't regret it."

"Of course I want to be the best. But I can never be the best with magic. You know when you see Shiro."

"Well, that kid definitely feels different."

"That's right. It's a subtle difference, but there are few people who can engrave that feeling. That's the area. The strongest competition that you can't even dare to compete with unless you're like Shiro."

It was a fight to see how much difference could be made among those who reached the same level.

"The pyramid of competition built with human blood and flesh. I came down from there. To go a new way with you."

"Thank you, Nade."

Nade, who hugged Liz, looked out the window where the bright sunlight was coming in and cheered for his friend's future.

'Good luck, Shiro.'

Thor Mia Kingdom Magic Association.

"It's annoying."

Rufist, who attended a special trial and returned, slammed the desk and it split as if it had been axed.

"Did you finally get it through?"

The expression of Secretary General Jane was not good either.

"Unanimously. Shiro can't graduate. Criminals are deprived of the right to use public institutions."

"Criminal. What's the charge?"

"Insult to royalty."

"Did Shiro... insult the royalty?"

The file that Rufist threw fell under the broken desk, but it was a matter that didn't need to be read anyway.

"He committed twenty-two crimes. Omission of honorifics, humiliation of royalty, sexual harassment, assault, etc. He hung everything he could hang."

"But that's a problem that Pony Yang agreed to deal with when she entered magic school, right? If you argue like that, other students also committed crimes against Pony Yang."

"The standard is ambiguous. If the party only feels ashamed of Shiro, that's it. It's really big to be a commoner."

"It didn't look like that."

"Twenty-two crimes. He must have committed a crime. Anyway, Shiro is expelled."

"Is there no way?"

"Do you think I didn't try? I even went to the king, but it didn't work."

"Then what about Shiro?"

"He said he would go to the Yongrye. He said he would become a dragon knight."

"Dragon knight?"

"Yes. He said he would become the strongest with his own power, not magic."

"Is that possible?"

"I don't know. But if it's Shiro, it might be possible."

"Then what about Pony Yang?"

"She said she would follow him. She said she would become a dragon knight too."

"Two dragon knights?"

"Yes. Two dragon knights."
[Translated block]
"Sure, that would be. This is a picture that came out of the politicians' heads."

"......It's about taming Shirone."

"Yes. I'm not really going to graduate. The average trade value of Shirone set by scouts around the world is about 2.25 billion gold. There are also rumors that the Jinchun Empire has prepared 30 billion gold, separate from research."

Considering Jinchun's aggressive moves in the wizarding community recently, it wasn't entirely impossible.

"If Shirone is released on a free contract, the kingdom can't afford it. So they block graduation itself. It's a rule that those who are not eligible for graduation are not listed on the red line."

"But it's a dangerous strategy. It's not just the red line that Shirone can choose, right?"

"If you choose the black line, your family, friends, and everyone involved will be harmed. The white line has not been replenishing additional personnel for nearly four years. Even if they do, would there be a fool who would reject the kingdom's offer expecting to be the world's number one?"

Shirone certainly set a tremendous record, but Thor Mia was also just a country from a global perspective.

"It's a blocked situation."

"The top also thinks it's certain, so they're pushing it. They will ask for a terrible contract on the condition of abolishing the royal insult. It will be about 100 million, and the rest of the money will go into the pockets of politicians."

"It's a bit bitter."

"I'm not feeling good as a wizard either. But if you do this, you're less likely to be taken away by other countries. Whether we treat it or not, it's beneficial for us to strengthen the association's power. The negotiation team is probably leaving now."

"Do you think Shirone will accept it easily?"

"Just close your eyes and bend once. Then not only graduation but also the future as a wizard is guaranteed."

"In the system of the Kingdom of Thor Mia."

Jane knew why she was hanging.

"I hope you make a wise choice as a smart guy, but......"

When Nade returned to school, he found that the advanced students were gathered in front of the central bulletin board.

"What's up? Did something happen?"

As he read down the public notice through the crowd, his eyes shook with shock and his body turned around involuntarily.

"Shirone! Where's Shirone?"

When he opened the dormitory door, Shirone was sitting alone on the bed with Iruki and Amy by his side.

"What happened? Royal insult!"

Shirone raised his hand with a tired expression.

"Welcome back. Did you have fun with Liz?"

"That's not the problem right now! What's graduation cancellation?"

Iruki said.

"Don't make a fuss. We've already done it without you."

Nade, who brought a chair and sat down, asked as if he was arguing.

"Why did this happen all of a sudden?"

"It's a plot of the kingdom. Pony sued Shirone. Ogent is preparing an appeal, but it won't work. It's a special trial by royal decree."

Nade's eyes were filled with vigor.

"Where's Pony? I'll go see her."

Amy said.

"She's in the girls' dormitory. But it's already controlled. The wizards of the Magic Association Creas branch are guarding it like iron. We also tried to force our way in and were almost taken away."

"Is it a problem to be taken away! No, if it's Shirone's skill, you can get in without being caught!"

Shirone smiled bitterly.

"Pony didn't lead it. It's not that kind of personality. It must have been ordered from the family. Iruki thinks it's a plot to lower the contract conditions. So I'm going to wait for now."

"No, it's a situation where it's not enough to beg! Somehow, you have to find a way. There are two children of the top aristocratic family as friends."

"It's a royal decree. The aristocratic title doesn't help."

"Terage! He said he knew you a little, right? Even if it's a royal family, if the empire moves, it can't move!"

Iruki shook his head again this time.

"This is an internal affair of the kingdom. If Kashan interferes in domestic affairs, Gustav and Jinchun will also move on the pretext. Do you understand what I'm saying? Now we're not students. It's a real battlefield."
[Translated block]


"Reality or not, it's unreasonable!"

"Calm down and think rationally. If you get marked by the kingdom, you can't do business in this country. If you get more involved, it could harm senior Liz. Is that what you want?"

Thinking like that, his heart sank and the huge reality rushed in.

"I'm guessing, but they'll ask for a back contract in exchange for graduation. Holding your family hostage. The best you can do is try to raise the contract conditions as much as possible. After all, Shiro thinks it's not bad to stay in Thormia."

"Stay here? Even though they despise you like this?"

Shiro spoke, holding Amy's hand.

"I don't want to leave Amy. It's like becoming a wizard. You'll be able to get a job at the Magic Association."

At this point, where the sensation of the first kiss is still vivid, it was impossible to ruin all that happiness.

"Ah, really! I'm going to lose my temper!"

Unlike Nade, who was blowing up, Shiro and Amy just looked at each other with apologetic eyes.

Because opposing the king's decision means accepting that they can't be together in the future, they had no choice but to watch out for who would speak first, fearing they would get hurt.

'Yes, it's okay if it's a little unreasonable. If I'm with Amy...'

Because there will be much more happy days than sad days.

Then someone knocked on the door.

"Arian Shiro! It's a royal command! Welcome the administrative officer of the Royal Magic Department!"

"I'll go out now."

Shiro, who had finished preparing his mind, looked back at his friends as he walked towards the door.

"See you later. I'll need some advice when negotiating."

There were already students gathered in the central square, and the golden carriage was standing with an escort.

Next to the administrative officer of the Magic Department, Raiman, was a pony with a dried up spirit, standing with its head bowed.

'You've been tamed.'

The eyes of the once intelligent wizard were empty, as if the soul had been drained.

Pony, too, was just one of many royal family members who had resisted the king's decision this time.

'I'm a puppet. A puppet of bloodline.'

Pony, who had become a puppet, wanted to die rather than feeling humiliated.

'What am I...?'

It seemed less shameful to be naked, and when Shiro's knees bent, she even felt dizzy.

'Well, surprisingly obedient. It means the judgment is over. Then, starting from 80 million is too much, let's start from 80 million.'

If you can save 20 million, you can drop about 500,000, and you plan to use that money for your daughter's study abroad.

'I don't like it. I don't like this.'

Watching Shiro's hand reach down to touch the ground, Amy bit her lip.

'Because of me, because of me...'

She wanted to stop him right now, but because Shiro wanted her as much as she wanted him, she couldn't open her mouth.

"Your noble royal family."

Unlike what he had said, Shiro, who had been thinking for a long time, slowly straightened his knees and turned his head towards the students.

"I'm sorry, Amy. I..."

Amy burst into tears and nodded her head vigorously.

"Yes. Do that, Shiro."

Only her consent was important to Shiro, who stared straight at Raiman and opened his mouth.

"By the grace of the noble Pony royal family, I will kneel and apologize on this spot!"

Raiman, who had folded the public document, made a fuss.

"Hurry up and kneel and beg, you humble thing! Put your forehead on the ground and grind it!"

It was the will of the state to tame it from the beginning, but Pony, who had become a puppet, wanted to die rather than feeling humiliated.

'I am... what am I?'

It seemed less shameful to be naked, and when Shiro's knees bent, she even felt dizzy.

"But!"

As expected, there was a reversal as Ilruki predicted.

"The merciful Pony royal family will forgive the foolish mistake of the poor. Kneel down and apologize here!"

Raiman, who had folded the public document, made a fuss.

"Hurry up and kneel and beg, you humble thing! Put your forehead on the ground and grind it!"

"I'm sorry, but I can't accept that name. I haven't done anything wrong to Pony,"

Lyman opened his eyes in disbelief.

"What, what?"

Pony, unable to bear the shame, burst into tears, and Eruki muttered with a bitter smile.

"I've finally done it."
