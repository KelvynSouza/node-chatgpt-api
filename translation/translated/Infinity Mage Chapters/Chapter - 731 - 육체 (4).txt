[731] Flesh (4)

* * *

Hwangseong Aganos.

The administrator of the 3.8th floor where the Grand Mage is sleeping came into Wuorin's room following Gando.

"Your Majesty, all of Shiro's debts have been repaid."

When no answer came back, the manager cautiously added.

"There is no debt left at the end of the day."

It was Wuorin's order.

'But it may not be Teraje's judgment.'

Gando thought so.

Originally, a second of leeway should have been left in Shiro's debt to plan a decisive moment.

It was not a waste to put a prominent grand mage in the empire to sleep forever as a price.

'What made Your Majesty change?'

Wuorin sang in a soft voice.

"I see. There will be rewards soon."

The manager clapped his hands in surprise.

"No, my conscience expects such a thing......."

"Take it. You've worked hard."

"Your grace is very deep."

No matter how deep the manager's loyalty was, he could not help but be excited about the reward of Wuorin, who has the greatest reward in the world.

"Your Majesty, why did you give such an order?"

When the manager left the room, Gando asked.

Even if she is the empress of the empire, it is possible to fall in love, but it did not suit Teraje to blur her judgment.

"Nothing has changed. I'm just reorganizing the board."

Gando doesn't know yet.

How much pain Wuorin had been waiting for today after Shiro accepted the proposal of the Mudeungryong Karatorsa.

'This is the world where Shiro lives.'

I can finally meet you.

"Gando, the world will change. Everything we've looked down on so far will overwhelm us."

What's really important is......

Finally turning around, Wuorin smiled warmly, which she had never seen before.

"It's the beginning of a true great war."

* * *

The fist of Imir, who cut through the void, vibrated.

'What's going on?'

Even if you throw your heart at the speed of thought, his flesh is solid enough to have no cracks.

'I got caught in Simta.'

However, the shock of the mind that occurs when the act of the flesh is contrary to the result was considerable.

'Is it the ability of an angel?'

According to his memory, the magic circle that the magician had cast a while ago was the Valhalla action of Icarus.

Shiro, who grabbed the holy sound and rolled on the ground, frowned.

"Kuk!"

Even though he pulled in all the time of 19,000 people and surpassed the super-strong of the holy sound, the shock that the main body received exceeded imagination.

'This is Imir......'

He has faced many strong enemies so far, but this is the first time he has twisted space-time with the power of the flesh.

"Princess! Are you okay!"

When the ether wave disappeared and the space returned, Moon Kyung looked after the holy sound.

"Princess......!"

The first thing that came into view was Shiro lying on top of the holy sound.

'Uh, why......?'

The moment the weight of Shiro pressing on the skin and the embarrassing posture of falling down was conveyed.

"Huh? Uh......"

The brilliant wisdom and cold reason disappeared, and only an unknown shock swept through his head.

"You, you, you, you......!"

Moon Kyung saw the holy sound stuttering so badly for the first time.

"How dare! My, my body......!"

Before the words were over, Shiro picked up the holy sound and teleported away from Imir.

"Get a grip. It's not over yet."

During the short time of teleportation, the holy sound, who had reconsidered Imir's existence, pushed Shiro and stood up.

"Heh, I just underestimated the opponent."

It was indeed a judgment worthy of an Ivory Tower candidate, but he couldn't hide his face flushed like a red poem.

'What a disgrace...'

She, who had never allowed the touch of others, still vividly felt the weight of Shirone.

'Getting help from a competitor.'

Yet, she couldn't repay the favor of the person who saved her life with ingratitude, so she was just burning inside.

"What ridiculous guys."

What brought back Sung-eum's sanity was Imir's fighting spirit, which seemed to transcend the limits of living beings.

Watching Imir, who seemed about to jump out at any moment, bending his waist awkwardly, Shirone said,

"Be careful. If you don't kill it here..."

"I know."

Sung-eum's eyes regained their usual sharpness.

"I'll take responsibility. I will never let that monster out into the world."

Although it was nothing more than a molar of the main body, it was a force that could end a city in an instant.

"It doesn't seem like you guys woke me up..."

When it came to combat, Imir's animal-like sense of smell never missed.

"Simta?"

The moment Imir's eyes bulged, Shirone and Sung-eum felt their bodies twisting.

'An incredible pressing...!'

It was an eye technique of a different dimension from what they had experienced so far.

"Die."

The ground quietly collapsed as if it would soon explode, and then Imir's body disappeared with a roar.

'It's coming!'

It was a speed that couldn't be avoided with a simple sense of explosion, and a magic circle of Valhalla action rose above Shirone's head.

'Huh?'

The calculation to reverse the cause and effect was completed, but the spirit zone swayed and shook due to overload.

'No! If this breaks...!'

The events that 19,000 Shirone's were experiencing would also disappear in vain.

"Shirone!"

Before Lian's voice could reach, Imir turned at a terrifying speed.

'It's this guy!'

For the first time in a long time, his battle instincts awakened, and he felt every single cell sparkling.

'A swordsman?'

The moment Lian's eyes met.

'I was cut.'

The fact that his heart was cut first meant that the swordsman in front of him was using the same technique as him.

"Hueeup!"

When Imir raised his arm and blocked the great sword, Lian's temples bulged.

'Damn it! It's blocked!'

It was the shock of Simta, which he experienced for the first time.

"What are you?"

It was definitely a familiar smell, and that's why it was unpleasant, but Lian's appearance was not in Imir's memory.

"Imir?"

The moment Lian realized his identity late, Imir hit his abdomen with a front kick.

"Annoying."

With a dull sound, the elbow part broke off and Lian's torso flew like a cannonball.

"Lian!"

Kido, who arrived late, caught it, but couldn't handle the shock and rolled on the ground.

"Uaaaak!"

Lian, who barely regained his balance, glared at Imir on his knees.

His two arms were hanging from the handle of the great sword stuck in the arm of the giant.

"Imir."

The memories of swinging his sword countless times thinking of him after meeting in heaven passed by like a slide show.

"Hmm, it's Simta. But still..."

Imir, who pulled out the great sword and dropped Lian's arm, stood the <Idea> vertically.

"There aren't many swords that can cut my muscles."

Imir, who held the sword horizontally, grabbed the handle and the tip of the blade and exerted a force as if to bend it.

"Hoo-woo-woo-woo!"

As an unimaginable force was applied, space began to ripple around Imir.

"Here I go!"

Eventually, the air was sucked in all at once, causing an explosion and shaking Andre.

Koo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

Moon Kyung, who turned his head at the roar, looked at Imir again and his face turned pale.

'That, that can't be.'

Despite the power that could kill people with just the wind pressure, there was not even a slight deformation in the <Idea>.

"Die."

The ground quietly collapsed as if it would soon explode, and then Imir's body disappeared with a roar.

'It's coming!'

It was a speed that couldn't be avoided with a simple sense of explosion, and a magic circle of Valhalla action rose above Shirone's head.

'Huh?'

The calculation to reverse the cause and effect was completed, but the spirit zone swayed and shook due to overload.

'No! If this breaks...!'

"Kekeke. Kekekeke."

Imir, who nodded his head, looked back at Lian.

"Now I understand why you woke up."

The great sword is probably an objet d'art.

But as far as Imir knew, there was only one being who could imagine a concept that would never be destroyed.

"You, what's your relationship with Ogent?"

Lian stood up, bending his broken arm.

"I am Ogent Lian."

"Huh? Ogent?"

Imir raised an eyebrow.

He couldn't feel any nostalgia for Ogent from Lian's masculine appearance.

"I don't remember, but..."

Unlike other parts, Imir's molars had been buried independently in the ruins for a very long time.

"Well, I'll know when I hit it with my body."

That was Imir's way, and he, holding the great sword like a spear, threw it with tremendous force.

Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!

Lian, who watched his sword penetrate the wall and disappear, twisted his face.

Imir dusted off his palm and said,

"It's not a sword you can swing by imitating it poorly."

Unless it was a force comparable to the king of giants, one could not realize the true terror of <Idea>.

"Shall we start by dealing with the interrupters first?"

When Imir turned around, Mungyeong, who was guarding the holy sound, drew his sword and shouted.

"Shut up! Who told you to do that..."

His words were cut off in the middle, and Shiro-ne and the holy sound also looked over Imir's shoulder with shocked eyes.

Ooduk! Ooduk!

Feeling creepy at the unique sound of a creature breaking, Imir slowly turned his head.

"Li, Lian..."

Kido, who had been hit in the buttocks, was trembling as he looked up at a goblin that resembled Lian.

"I've been waiting for this day, Imir."

There was always Imir at the end of the sword.

"Really? I don't know who you are."

Lian's back exploded, and the torn muscle fibers fluttered like a mirage.

"Don't take a step from there and come to me. If not, you'll regret it."

Lian's transformation was powerful, but...

"It's interesting. I'm looking forward to what will happen?"

The enemy he was facing now was Imir, the king of giants, who was called the strongest creature in history.

"Krrrrrrrr!"

Lian's eyes rolled back and the fluttering muscle fibers quickly twisted and sucked into his body.

The shape of the muscles, which were completely different from humans and seemed to be made only for battle, was like looking at a goblin.

Transcendence of God - Metamorphosis.

"Imitating that..."

As Lian rushed to the ground, Imir also twisted his upper body with a terrifying momentum.

At the horizontal seesaw of time, the two bodies moved as if they would never reach each other.

"Yaaaaaaa!"

The fists were exchanged at the speed of thought.

'Heart Fist! Heart Hit! Heart Fist! Heart Hit! Heart Fist! Heart Fist! Heart Hit! Heart Fist!'

As the meat chunks split with a sound like a continuous explosion, and the labyrinth was embroidered, Mungyeong shivered.

'What the hell...'

It felt like pain was transmitted just by the sound.

'What kind of human is that?'

For the first time, Imir was curious.

'Ogent Lian. Ogent... Huh?'

In the pouring fist, Imir, who confirmed Lian's face, had his eyes full of strength.

'Blue hair.'

It's not Ogent.

'That's right.'

That's how it was connected.

'Smile!'

Looking at Lian's heart fist stretching at a tremendous speed, Imir burst into joy.

"It's been a while, Ogent!"

With a bang, both of their jaws turned at the same time, and the eyes of those who were watching were tightly closed.

"Cough!"

One of Imir's teeth flew out of his mouth and pierced through the labyrinth with tremendous force.

Kwaaaaang!

Looking at the cave wall that was cleanly pierced, Mungyeong, who was shocked, turned his gaze back to Imir.

"Phew!"

He spat on the floor and wiped his lips.
