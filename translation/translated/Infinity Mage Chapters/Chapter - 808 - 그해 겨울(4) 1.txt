That winter (4)

Shirone relaxed his posture and went to Kai.

"I am a friend of Lian..."

Kai's sword flashed like a flash, and a vertical wind rushed with a sharp momentum.

It was a simple wind, but it was enough to cut the skin, and Shirone, who had avoided it, turned his head.

"No. If you relax during the war." Shirone spoke quickly.

"I am Shirone, a friend of Lian. I heard that the eldest son of the Ogent family is a spy in a foreign country due to the king's work."

If true, Kai was not an enemy.

"Spy?"

Kai laughed with his sword on his shoulder.

"Who says that, am I a spy?"

"That's the family...

Kai's laughter stopped abruptly.

"I heard, a cute youngest brother has a friend. Maybe that guy is the current Ivory Tower's Five Saints?"

It was a sarcastic tone, but Shirone was polite.

"Yes. I am that Five Saints." Kai lowered his posture.

"Is Lian okay?"

"I haven't heard the exact news since we broke up a year ago. But wherever he is, he will do well."

"Is that so? It's a pity."

The moment Kai felt shaken, the ground under his feet soared with a bang.

"I wanted to pass on the will."

Kai, who had suddenly approached, teleported Shirone.

"Slow!"

The blade passed through the neck.

"??????What?"

Shirone, who felt the explosion and felt the past of 1 second ago as the present, retreated tens of meters and gasped.

"Ah, time."

Kai, who had picked the neck of the Grand Wizard like a bunch of grapes, knew well the strangeness of magic.

"How about this?"

When the black-haired genius applied 'fold' to all seven schemas, a human embossment was printed on the transparent air with a bang.

It can't be faster than light, but the blade flew in before Shirone started any thoughts.

'Even if you have a god in your head, the vessel is just flesh and blood.'

The only thought was dizzy, and before the nine senses opened, the flash was drawn horizontally.

Kuuuuuuuuuuuu!

If you can hear the sound of the sun, it would be like the sound of air burning now.

"It's annoying."

Minerva held Shirone's back and retreated endlessly.

Because she couldn't even detect Kai's movements at a clumsy distance, she stopped at a distance of 280 meters.

"Are you okay?"

"No. I almost died." Shirone spoke honestly.

"I've never seen such a strong swordsman before." Would it feel like this if I fought with Lian?

"Lack of experience... It's not a level to say. If we are the peak of magic, that is the peak of swordsmanship."

Minerva's expression was not good either.

"Honestly, if it's the same rank, I prefer to avoid swordsmen. No matter how strong the spirit is, the body is direct. You have to stand strategically at a distance."

If it was a low-ranking swordsman, he would press it with a frontal battle, but originally this was the orthodoxy to deal with swordsmen.

'Or, there is a swordsman of that level on our side.'

I wanted to see Lian.

"Stay at least 300 meters away. Otherwise, you won't be able to get the reaction time until the magic is implemented."

"No. I don't want to fight." It wasn't just because Kai was strong.

"Lian's brother. I don't know why he's in Gustav, but it's a loss to fight here."

"Kid."

Kai heard his voice from a distance of 300 meters.

"You don't know Lian well. Like I chose a sword and abandoned my family, Lian is the same."

Shirone used sound magic.

"No. I know Lian. If he fights for such a reason, he will be disappointed in me."

"That might be. I don't know how the guy grew up. But, you know, I can't die here, can I?"

Kai took a charge posture.

"This time, I'll kill you."

Even from afar, Shiro could see the terrifying gamble and his eyes narrowed fiercely.

"Did you really abandon Thor Mia? If there's something you can't say...

"Shh."

The small voice sounded like thunder.

"Why is Odaesung so talkative?"

Knowing that he couldn't fight while babbling, Shiro also shut his mouth.

"We must avoid it at all costs. Let's attack from both sides."

Minerva sucked deeply on her pipe, and Kai's killing intent rose vertically like a great sword.

An emergency alarm rang inside Ex Machina.

"Damn it! What the hell is this?"

Iruki stared at the result derived from Ex Machina's transcendent computational ability.

"Failure? Why?"

The simulation that had been run thousands of times concluded that they could not kill Habitz in actual combat.

Gudio gritted his teeth.

"The variable was imaginary from the start. According to calculations, Habitz should have escaped the capital to protect Abella."

Then, being pierced in the heart by "Law Kill" was the law calculated by Ex Machina.

"Can't Habitz be tied to the law with Alpha Pisces' trap?"

Iruki shouted.

"It's too early to give up!"

"How?"

"We've entered Bashken anyway. If we twist the law of 'Law Kill', we can chase Habitz again!"

Ness's skull-like eyes widened.

"No! It's too dangerous!"

The law that works on "Law Kill" is a huge one where all the laws within a radius of 200 kilometers are intertwined.

"I can do it...

It's not yours, Albino said.

"I'm doing it."

A radiance burst from Iruki's eyes, who had executed the overdrive.

' Cancellation!'

His spirit zone, which tracked the location of "Law Kill" through Ex Machina, canceled the law.

"Ugh!"

It was a completely different weight from canceling a single magic, and blood tears flowed from both eyes.

"Iruki! Stop! You have to stop!" As the brake was applied to the trajectory of "Law Kill" flying straight towards Habitz, it drew a curve.

"Just reset the coordinates!" The rest will be taken care of by the medium of "Law Kill".

'My head is going to explode!'

Whether the brain water in Ex Machina explodes first, or "Law Kill" changes the coordinates first.

"Iruki! If you die here, there's no future!" 

That's right.

'No, this is where I should die!' He knew that if he couldn't do it now, the end of reason would come.

'The world of chaos opens.'

As his vision filled with blood, he could no longer see even the monitor of Ex Machina.

"Go!"

Finally, as the trajectory of "Law Kill" headed towards where Habitz was, he faced chaos again.

"I did it!"

People playing card games clenched their fists.

'Great, Iruki! You did it!' When there was no response from Iruki, who was sitting in the lead, Agaya stood up and looked.

"Iruki! Iruki!"

He was convulsing with blood constantly flowing from his eyes, nose, and ears.

"Die, die!"

"Law Kill". Even in the midst of aiming for the heart, Habitz was in a frenzy, killing indiscriminately.

"I mean...

Just then, a soldier ran up to Balkan.

"Sir! You have to evacuate quickly! Now to the residential outskirts...

Before the report was finished, a scream that seemed to tear the air embroidered the ceiling.

"What!" At the edge of visibility, a single dagger was flying around like a one-winged insect, piercing the bodies of the soldiers.

Abella realized the situation and shouted.

"Honey! Let's stop and go!" Habitz, who had stopped moving, spotted the flying dagger.

'Hide and seek?'

Just by looking at the trajectory of the dagger, he could tell how much he wanted to kill Habitz.

'Then I should run away.'

A smile ripped through Habitz's mouth as he grabbed Abella's hand.

"Fuahaha! Balkan! Escape!" It was a thought that sprang up like a fish from chaos, and that thought was always right for Habitz.

"Natasha! Take the princess!" As Natasha guarded Habitz's rear, the guards rushed out of the city.

The "Law Blade" followed with a scream.

"Damn it! What's so fast?"

The short sword that pierced through people like a needle through paper flew straight towards Habitz.

"The martial arts of the Death God."

As Natasha, who had stopped in her place, turned to look at the "Law Blade" and unfolded her fire magic, a skeleton in a black robe appeared.

"I'll smash it!"

As she sprung up from the ground like a spring and reached out towards the "Law Blade", the air rang with a twang.

"What the??????!"

Ignoring Natasha's hand, the "Law Blade" that had been coiling around her body flew towards Habitz.

"Your Highness!"

Balkan shouted.

"Huh?"

As Habitz blinked and turned around, the blade of the "Law Blade" had arrived, emitting a creepy light.

"What?"

At the same time, the world froze in a gray hue.

"Aaaaaah."

Following the funeral song from the sky, twelve figures in black clothes rose from the ground where Habitz stood.

"We are Hell."

Every 0.666 seconds.

"Greet Him."

A doll, as if its skin had been peeled off in lava, rose and opened its burning eyes.

"Poor thing, you sacrificial lamb of the law." Habitz glanced at Satan for a moment and then poked at the frozen Abella.

There was no feeling of pressing.

"What are you?"

"I am the root of all demons, including you. I am Satan. I have come to save you today."

"Save me? From what?"

"Death."

Satan's hand, dripping with blood, pointed at the "Law Blade" hanging in the air.

"Even I can't touch the blade of hatred. You can never escape. How about making a deal with me?"

Satan brought his index finger to his face.

"Become my servant and judge the world. It is to dye this world with evil together with the demons."

"Hmm."

Habitz, who had been thinking with his chin propped up, spoke.

"No."

Satan's eyes opened grotesquely.

"Are you saying you're okay with dying?"

"I haven't thought about that, but the reason I don't like it is because I still want to play with my friends."

He wanted to play with Abella a little more.

"Even so, you will die in less than a second."

"That one second is fun, one second."

Habitz couldn't stand even 0.1 seconds of boring things.

"......To be attached to something like love. Did I think wrong? I thought you were suitable to receive my grace."

Satan went back into the lava.

"You will regret it."

Listening to the majestic funeral song, Habitz grabbed his wife's wrist with happy eyes.

"Let's go, Abella."

To the world of eternal freedom.

As the 0.666 seconds of that moment were released, the "Law Blade" flew towards Habitz with the same inertia.

From 0.777 seconds, numerous thoughts flooded into Habitz's head at the same time.

'Join hands with Satan and conquer the world?'

It was disgusting to bring parents to the playground.

'Talking nonsense. There are still so many things we can play together.'

0.888 seconds.

0.999 seconds. This is the moment.
