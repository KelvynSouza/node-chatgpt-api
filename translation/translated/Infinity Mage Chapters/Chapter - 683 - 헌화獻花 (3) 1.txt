'Rain is pouring down.'

Shirone, who spread his wings, rushed towards the living flower at full speed.

All the devices of the concealment facility had stopped operating, so their powerful anti-aircraft defense network was also paralyzed.

However, that fact made them feel a sense of crisis.

'Something's strange?'

The state of the living flower felt through the Ultima system was like the night before a storm.

It seemed to be quietly stationary, but inside the huge iron tower seen through the eyes of Jikji, numerous energies were moving around like nerves, forming the shape of a living flower.

'Full power operation. They're preparing something.'

If you follow the mechanism of the living flower's input and output, it is clear that a powerful energy beam is on standby.

'Could it be, the capital?'

It was entirely possible, and this was the reason why Luphist had tried to approach the living flower as much as possible, even at the risk of sacrifice.

"Brother Shirone."

Maylei, who caught up with Shirone by teleportation, flew side by side with her wet body.

"I'm glad you're safe."

Shirone, who thought he had become somewhat familiar, spoke comfortably, and Maylei also smiled shyly.

She was a magician, but she was not so excellent as to be classified as a combatant.

Shirone, who thought she might have already died if she hadn't met her colleagues, was relieved.

"I was lucky. I fell in an area where there were no enemies."

"How's the signal?"

Maylei spoke while blocking one ear.

"I can't hear anything. I keep checking, but there's not even a common noise. This is definitely strange."

It means that La Enemy is no longer giving instructions.

'Has the design already been completed? Or......'

As Shirone was lost in thought, two people approached, jumping over the building.

"Lian. Huh?"

His eyes went to the goblin following him.

'A goblin wearing glasses for the first time?'

When Shirone and Maylei stopped, Kido landed on the roof with a nimble action.

"Hoo, finally we meet."

Kido, who landed in front of Shirone with various poses, smiled while pushing his glasses.

"Um, but who are you?"

It was believable that he was not an enemy just because he came with Lian.

"The head of the Speed Killers."

Kido, who spoke jokingly, became awkward when Shirone had no particular reaction.

"......I was a goblin, Kido."

"What happened?"

When Shirone turned his head, Lian approached and explained.

Since he had already guessed La Enemy's intentions through the conversation with Etela, he was quick to understand.

"I see. Corresponding to taste......"

"Is this hearing?"

When Kido pointed with sharp nails, Maylei nodded her head.

"Hmm, so touch, hearing, and taste are gathered. But to track La, we definitely need smell."

"Shagal must have already entered the living flower. We don't have time either."

Shirone was about to turn around, but Kido reached out his hand.

"Wait. I have one suggestion before that."

Everyone looked at Kido.

"What suggestion?"

"Can I eat you guys if it's okay?"

If you can get information by eating, it was good to know the memories of Shirone and Maylei.

"I don't mind, but."

Shirone glanced at Maylei.

It was possible to heal if Shirone was eaten by Armand, but she had no means of recovery.

Maylei touched her right ear and spoke.

"Wouldn't it be better to cut off the ear? Other body parts will result in a loss of combat power. If you don't have ears, the function of the frequency of God will be enhanced."

Kido opened his mouth blankly, but Shirone strongly opposed.

This was a matter that had already been discussed at the time of the test in the Silver Ring Guild.

"That's the last resort. If you can't catch La Enemy with one sense, the function of communication is also important."

Kido laughed and said.

"There's no need to worry. It's enough if it's body fluids, not necessarily body parts. Also, there are limits to the information that is transmitted anywhere if it is not a memory engraved on a specific organ."

Lian said with a slightly wronged expression.

"So you don't need to eat a lot."

"Hehe, that's the advantage of my ability."

Goblins are a gluttonous race, but the objective amount they can eat is less than humans.

"Okay, then I'll give you my blood."

Shirone cut her left palm long and dropped the blood.

Due to the difference in height, Kido could drink just by raising his head.

"Hmm. Hmm."

Kido's eyes deepened as he rolled his tongue and savored the taste of blood.

"I see. You're a very interesting human, aren't you?"

"You don't seem to be easy either."

"Hehehe! It would be difficult if you were surprised at this level."

Kido, who was shaking his lungs, said to Meirei.

"Goblins have no manners, but I still don't want to hurt women. If you don't want to peel off your skin, you can pass saliva."

Meirei, who was looking at Kido expressionlessly, held out her wrist.

"I'll do it with blood."

A momentary look of disappointment crossed his face, but Kido soon approached with a playful expression.

"Then I won't refuse."

When Kido bit his wrist with sharp fangs and sucked his lips, her blood came over.

As her eyelids fluttered, a certain specific memory was conveyed.

'Huh? What is this?'

There would be very few people who lived as colorful a life as Shirone, but Meirei's memory was different from that.

'What? What kind of memory is this?'

"How long are you going to suck? It hurts."

"Huh? Oh, sorry."

Kido, who quickly took his mouth off, blinked his eyes and looked at Meirei.

"Why?"

There was no information to be gained from her natural expression.

'Does she not even know herself?'

When Kido's thoughts reached that point, he suddenly realized.

'I see. Hehehe, this is going really exciting, isn't it? Maybe......'

It could have been a counter to La Enemy.

"Okay, I've accepted it. Let's get started."

When Kido hurried using the point that time was urgent, the party also flew without grumbling.

It was raining as if a hole had been opened in the sky.

The time left until Life Flower intercepts Wangseong is 7 minutes and 32 seconds.

Jane's footsteps, which calculated the time roughly, gradually accelerated.

To increase speed, more blood is needed, and the more the hand squeezing the heart resists, the more severe it becomes.

"Cough! Cough!"

Although the hand squeezing the heart had already lost its sensation, the transcendental magic kept the body moving beyond the limit of human muscle strength.

It was a task to replace the heart muscle with the arm muscle when looking at the human body as a machine, but the durability could not be the same, and eventually the muscles and tendons began to break off.

Since it was a magic, not a law, the arm that had already functioned physically did not move anymore.

"Huh!"

When the heart stopped again, Jane's eyes widened.

'With the other hand......'

It was never more grateful that human arms were attached to both sides.

When I changed my hand and contracted my heart again, the bodily functions returned and death was postponed.

The sound of Aria's sobbing echoed in my ears like a hallucination, but there was no room to answer.

Carrying her own death on her back, Jane entered the control room where the main system was.

Since I couldn't take my hand off my heart, I swung my hand, which had already been shattered, like a stick and activated the device.

-Aria, the code......

The sound of crying stopped and a huge amount of code poured in.

Aria was also doing her best.

Now the remaining time is 6 minutes and 22 seconds.

It was only to regain control, and to cancel the interception itself, I had to go to the cockpit, but Jane didn't have much time left.

"The association president will do it."

"Jane, are you okay?"

Even though it was just a voice, it was nice to be able to see someone off at the last moment.

"Aria, it's not your fault."

After a moment of silence, a calm voice seeped in.

"The country will never forget your sacrifice."

There was no contact after that.

Because I could no longer maintain the Spirit Zone.

"But still......"

The woman, leaning against the cold mechanical device, looked up at the ceiling.

"I kept my promise."

If you were to recall the happiest day of your life, it would undoubtedly be the day Rufus became the president of the Magic Association.

"Jane, you're a genius."

At Rufus's words, looking out the window from the president's office, Jane shrugged her shoulders.

"That's right."

"Have you ever felt superior? That you are far superior to others."

"Well, when I was very young? But why?"

"I've never felt anything like superiority. People ask why I don't pursue petty benefits. Even though I have powerful magic abilities and a position. But humans are not so great. Superiority is a feeling that is possible because there is something to compare. Whether you're a genius or a dunce, you're just a part of the system."

Even though he succeeded Gauld as the president of the association, there were talks about him being too extreme in civil society.

"I didn't know you cared about other people's evaluations?"

"I don't care. No, maybe I should care. The important thing is to face the facts."

"What do you think is the fact, Mr. President?"

"People are not equal."

Rufus was adamant.

"90 percent of people are responsible for production and reproduction. The remaining 10 percent of people consume their resources and lead the whole."

"That's a bit of a disgusting way of thinking."

"Disgusting. But what if it's true?"

Rufus looked back at Jane.

"Most people don't know how the world works. They take the things around them for granted, like air. They don't think about why they can have bread in front of them every morning."

"There's no need to criticize."

"Right. What's a more valuable life? What I want to say is, they can live because someone is facing that disgusting fact."

Rufus looked back at the nameplate that had not yet been replaced, engraved with the name of the former president of the Magic Association, Mikaia Gauld.

"I'll change it now."

Rufus nodded and put his hand on the nameplate.

"Gauld was popular. He even had a royal guard. He was human and had the power to attract people's hearts. But Jane, emotions alone cannot sustain the system. If Gauld empathizes with the pain of individuals from the extremes, I protect people from the extremes of the system. Even if it's disgusting, I think it's a mission that must be done as a core part of the kingdom called the president of the Magic Association."

"......I see."

It was a very personal inauguration speech dedicated only to Jane.

"I'm grateful to you. I couldn't have come this far without you."

Jane scratched her head awkwardly at the praise she had never received in her life.

"Well, it's something I should do. Besides, I became the secretary general."

"So......"

Rufus, who was leaning back bluntly, turned around and said briefly.

"I look forward to working with you."

Jane's eyes curled up thinly.

'It was the greatest honor of my life.'

Jane looked back on that day.

There was no great regret in life up to this point, but because she wanted to look back on the happiest memory for the last time, she clenched her heart endlessly.

But when the muscles in her wrist inevitably ruptured, she pulled her hand out of her stomach.

As the oxygen going to the brain was cut off, her mind was also sucked into a deep abyss.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
