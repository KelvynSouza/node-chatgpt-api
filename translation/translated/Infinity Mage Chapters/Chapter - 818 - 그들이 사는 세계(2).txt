The World They Live In (2)

The border area of Kashan and Zive.

In the middle of the sun-drenched desert, a man in priest's clothes was reading a book.

His curly black hair covered his face like a curtain under his black hat.

He, sitting on a rock with his long legs bent at right angles like a stork, sighed looking up at the sun.

"Ha."

Dry smoke puffed out in clumps.

"Is it coming again?"

When he looked down at the horizon, an old man with a black umbrella was approaching through the mirage.

"Do you still not put down the Bible?"

As if God had put him down, the old man was already close to the man.

"A life without mercy is like an endless desert."

"You abandoned God, didn't you?"

The old man added.

"To become a god." The Bible closed with a thud.

"What brings you here?"

"The Lord is looking for you." The priest's name was Nike, a vampire known as the strongest Almas in history.

"The weather is good."

He, with a skin color completely different from that of a vampire, looked up at the sun.

"......Are you okay?"

Vampires are weak to ultraviolet rays, but they can withstand it for a while with their unique powerful regeneration.

If you are an Almas class, you can withstand an average of about 4 hours, but your activity tends to decrease.

"Ha."

As Nike, with his brown skin burned, exhaled hot smoke, his skin quickly regenerated.

'He's a monster.'

His regeneration ability, which is more than 10 times stronger than other Almas, was close to the Lord.

"It's not that it's not painful just because you can stand it."

When Nike, who had a long slit in his lips, went into a biting state, the gums around his fangs went up.

"There is no immortality without pain."

They call it biting to chew on the target, and in that state, they can perform suction and injection.

Suction is sucking blood, and injection is the ability to inject prions to subdue the other party.

"What's the mission this time? Hybrid hunting?"

One-tenth of the half-mas spread all over the world were caught by Nike and subjected to brutal experiments.

"Jinma has arrived."

Nike's gaze turned to the old man for the first time.

"The vampire will eliminate all weaknesses and take over this world. He is currently collecting blood to wake up two lords."

"I see. What's my job?"

"Come to Zive. We will find you."

The old man, who said so, turned his face into a hideous bat face and dug into the ground in an instant.

U 99

Nike looked at where Zive was.

"The promised land."

When Lian arrived at the security headquarters, Benop was waiting for him as if his neck was cut off.

"What happened overnight? You don't look good."

"You don't look good either, Captain. Did you hear about the blood bank incident?"

"Don't even mention it. He tricked us from the kidney. The security chief didn't hear it either."

"I was at the scene."

"You?"

Lian spilled out what happened overnight.

"What? You met a hunter?"

"Yes. There was a person who could distinguish vampires. That's why they were always faster than us."

"Where are they?"

Lian shook his head.

"Well, they're doing unauthorized activities. So what are you going to do? Are you going to join them too?"

"I'm a foreigner. I don't want to get involved in the affairs of the royal family. And personally......

It was an opportunity to find out the secret of Smiley.

"I can't stop you if you say so. But let's exchange information occasionally."

He was surprisingly docile.

"What are you thinking?"

"Actually...... I understand your feelings. It seems that there is an internal spy in the royal family."

Benop made a secret proposal.

"We're going to hire hunters from all over the world in the royal family soon. To catch the hidden rat, you have to release the cat."

"The ones I know will not participate. They are...

"No, that's not what I'm talking about. You said the hunter you know can surely find the location of the vampire, right?"

Lian also caught on.

"Only if the conditions are right."

"There's a hunter hiring interview in Wangseong. High-ranking officials will also come to observe. It's a golden opportunity to expose an internal spy. If you help with this, I'll turn a blind eye to your hunter's business."

It was a good deal for both parties, and if Lian knew Genia, she would definitely agree.

"Let's talk. But you have to ensure my personal safety. He won't step forward himself."

"I know. I just need to know who the spy is. It won't be revealed since only you and I know."

After parting with Benoff, Lian arrived at the Genocide hideout, paying attention to being followed.

As people who fell asleep in the morning began to wake up one by one, Lian summoned everyone.

"...I got such a proposal." Grain stroked his chin and said.

"An internal spy. If there's a vampire attached to Wangseong, things will get difficult."

Paset said.

"It's unpleasant to feel like they're looking after us. But it's related to our work, right?"

Most seemed to agree, but in the end, the decision was up to Silver Bone Genia herself.

"I don't trust anyone."

Her colleagues, who knew her personality, shut their mouths.

"To be honest? The fact that Lian revealed our business itself makes me feel bad," Catein defended.

"They know about the hunter anyway. Silver Bone too. He just said we met."

"He said Silver Bone is here!"

Power said.

"He didn't say where. Genia, that's an excuse. We're also struggling to find the vampire's hideout. Wangseong publicly hires hunters. Maybe we can find a breakthrough through this."

Genia did not bend.

"I know, it's a good offer. So, this is my problem. A matter of feelings."

Lian said.

"I apologize if you were uncomfortable. I'm not forcing you. If you want, I'll cut off contact with them."

"Don't treat me like a kid! You said it's a good offer! Just, I am...

"Yeah, it must be scary."

Genia was neither human nor vampire.

"What?"

"It's scary to join hands with people you don't trust. But you don't have to hold hands."

"Hmph, easy for you to say. What if they try to use me? What if I have to fight as a human's dog for the rest of my life?"

"Then I'll fight for you."

Everyone looked at Lian.

"Whether it's King Zive, Shinjang, or the police, if they break their promise, I'll fight for you."

Genia couldn't understand Lian.

"How can you say that so easily? You're human, aren't you? Will you kill humans for me?"

"You're late if you think with a sword in your hand. The thought should always be over beforehand."

It was Lian's philosophy.

"What you can do with a sharp iron is not love or sacrifice. Taking responsibility for all the deaths I've made. I've already made that decision."

"You are...

As a vampire hunter, Genia must have created many deaths.

Perhaps those deaths she might have turned a blind eye to.

But Lian said he would take responsibility.

"Really? What if I want to protect someone? What if that person becomes a fugitive for life? Will you fight for me then?"

"Don't make me say it twice."

Hasn't he already made that decision?

"That's my belief."

It felt too far away, so Genia couldn't find a reason to insist anymore.

"I don't trust humans."

"Genia."

When Paset tried to step forward, Genia raised her head.

"But since you said you'd take responsibility, I'll help you this time. But you have to be by my side."

"Sure." 

When Lian nodded, Zenia turned away with a sullen expression.

"I'm hungry. Let's eat."

The corner of Grain's mouth rose slightly.

'You've met a good person, Zenia.'

Everyone has painful memories, but her pain of having to live as a half was longer than others.

'Maybe Lian can take responsibility for her cursed life.' No, it was only possible because it was Lian. The Genocide team wandered around Rodenin Street every night looking for the vampire's hideout.

They captured several vampires of the Vesica rank, but even they had no information about the upper ranks.

"Damn it! They're avoiding us like rats!"

In the medical room, Grain's brutal experiment to find out everything about the vampire was conducted.

"Kuaaaa! I'll kill you!" Zenia, who was inhaling Blood Q, was indifferent, but her companions saw her eyes.

'Zenia too...

I wonder if she screamed like that.

"It's not going to work."

As if she hadn't thought about it, Zenia stood up and said,

"We have no choice but to join hands with humans."

"Are you still thinking about it? We've already decided to do it, right? The hunter interview is tomorrow."

"What I'm told to do and what I do voluntarily are different. Lian, are you ready for sure?"

Lian handed over the hood.

"I'm going to go in wearing this. There won't be any identity checks, and we just need to watch from the highest place." It was the limit of what Benoff could do with his authority, but they had no choice but to trust him because Lian was by his side.

Pasette saw them off.

"Be careful. There's no sortie today, so you can eat something delicious when you're done."

"Do you think we're going on a trip?"

"Still, it's just the two of us. Have a private time."

At Pasette's whisper, Zenia didn't seem to dislike it and turned her body away without answering.

"Hehe, anyway, it's cute."

On the way to the bustling hunter interview, Lian, wearing a hood, asked Zenia,

"Are you okay?"

"I think I can bear it. The sun isn't strong today."

Nevertheless, she inhaled Blood Q steadily at the point where the public's attention disappeared.

"There is."

As soon as they arrived in Wangseong, they felt it.

"Vampire."

"How many?"

Zenia rolled her eyes.

"It's not that many. 3 or 4. But they're all Almas. Are you okay? You won't be able to stand this number."

"Who says I can't stand it?"

Lian, who had done his best in all battles since entering Rodenin, was still a human standard.

The essence is wild.

If he thought of destroying the area, even Almas could kill Zenia.

After receiving a formal inspection from Benoff, the two of them entered the Colosseum with their weapons.

The place where the security team was deployed was their place, and the officials of Wangseong were sitting in the seats across the street.

"Do you see?"

"Yeah, two."

Zenia inhaled Blood Q again.

"There, the young secretary. He's a vampire. And the old man sitting in the VIP seat. He's also a vampire."

They naturally hid in the shade.

"His Majesty is coming!"

King Meyer of Zive took the stage.

The royal guard 'Shinjang' gathered his legs and took a unique posture with his waist 45 degrees back.

'They're all strong.' Meyer declared.

"In the face of the devil's crowd boiling in the capital of the kingdom, we have come to gather competent hunters from all over the place. I hope you will do your best to contribute to the peace of Zive."

The iron gate rose and nearly 100 hunters entered the center of the Colosseum.

Lian, who had been watching their faces, heard a heavy breath and looked at Zenia.

"What's wrong?"

The face hidden in the hood was filled with astonishment.

'That guy.'

The one who caught her eye was a priest with a hawk-like impression and black hair down to his shoulders.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
