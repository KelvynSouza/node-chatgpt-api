"Work! It's work!"

When Justin burst into the guild's door, his subordinates were sleeping on the ruined building floor.

"Everyone get up, you scoundrels!"

Six men and one woman sat up with a haggard expression.

"Ugh, my stomach hurts. Why are you so noisy in the morning?"

Aeku, who felt the smell of vomit from last night, frowned at Justin.

"What? Noisy in the morning?"

Justin loaded a stun bullet into his gun.

"Is that something a guy who eats and lives in my guild should say?"

The moment they checked the muzzle of the gun, their stunned faces opened their eyes wide and threw their bodies.

"Run! We're going to die!"

Those who scattered in all directions closed their eyes tightly, expecting the sound of the stun bullet.

"Work, please."

Justin sighed and lowered his gun.

Inside the guild, which was roughly blocked by wooden boards, all members of Justin's mercenary group sat at the round table.

"So, we're going to escort the best runaway ladies in the world?"

Aeku asked absurdly.

"Yeah. Of course, I'm the only one who can go into the waiting room. You six will be on external security."

The Arachne government has put all its efforts into security without catching the blackmailer.

Even if there was no power, it was a situation where it had to be used, and the fact that Justin was a woman also worked well.

The woman at the counter asked.

"How much money do they give you?"

"It's performance-based. But even with the contract money, the guild's maintenance fee is enough. Plus, if this job is successful, the name value of the mercenary group will go up."

One of Aeku's eyes shone.

"In other words... are you saying that you're finally going out into the world?"

It's the revival of Justin's mercenary group.

"Yeah. It was decided in a hurry, but you can match it during rehearsal time. Briefing in the vacant lot in 10 minutes."

There were separate waiting rooms for participants and event staff at the World Beauty Contest venue.

"Hoo. Hoo."

Maya, who was just about to debut, sat in the waiting room for invited singers and breathed heavily.

'Why is this? My heart is beating so fast.'

Palmer, the head of the agency, came into the waiting room and handed Maya a sedative.

"Are you still like that?"

"Yes. But... I'll be okay."

She couldn't show a weak side as many people worked hard for today.

"Calm down. You worked hard. There was no mistake during rehearsal. You can do well."

'I should have made a mistake.'

The reason why she was more anxious because it ended neatly was because it was her first professional stage.

'Shirone....'

Maya spread the sheet music with the song title 'Light Rain'.

'Someday, you'll hear my song.'

It was a song that expressed the feelings of love she felt for Shirone, meaning that light was pouring down like a shower from the sky.

Seeing Maya calm down noticeably as she read the lyrics, Palmer licked his lips.

'I don't know who it is, but I'm blessed.'

When she first read the lyrics she submitted, everyone involved knew that it was not just a word for lyrics.

'Yes, it's just the beginning. If you can throw your heart away and throw it away, that's all you need.'

Palmer quietly gave up his seat.

Participant waiting room.

The room where the beauties representing 32 countries gathered was a silent battlefield.

The thought of the female security guard who was dispatched was the same.

'It won't be easy to control.'

Miss Biden, who was sitting with her legs spread out in her underwear, said irritably.

"Ha, boring."

There was no returning answer, and she, who liked to mingle with people, was suffocating.

'I wish I could smoke a cigarette.'

Since the surveillance network of competitors was spread to everyone, it was impossible to sneak out and smoke.

Miss Torumia, who was yawning and showing her armpits, looked at Miss Torumia next to her.

A woman with golden hair revealing her wide forehead, and beautiful eyebrows like pure gold.

"Hey, isn't it too early to be wearing a dress? You'll have to change anyway."

Alfred Pony closed his book and spoke.

"The dignity of royalty does not discriminate against time and place."

"Oh, are you royalty?"

The woman who unfortunately failed the graduation exam at the Thorumia Magic School due to Maya's irregularities took a leave of absence.

'This is the best choice I can make.'

The failure of the exam was a shock, but it was a shock to the world that her family had forced Sirona.

'If I win, I can also enter the privileged class.'

The winner of the beauty contest in any country receives preferential treatment from the government, which will be directly linked to the political power of the royal family.

"Hey, are you really royalty? Then do handsome people also flatter you?"

Pony, who didn't feel worth replying, tried to open the book again, but a hand suddenly came in front of him.

When he looked up, Miss Arachne was approaching with a fresh smile.

"Nice to meet you. I am Barho Langi."

The Kingdom of Arachne has produced many world champions for generations, and Langi was also a strong candidate for the championship.

"I'm Alfred Pony. I can't say I'm glad to meet you."

"Haha, you're straightforward. Definitely like a wizard, right?"

Probably all the participants would have obtained the profiles, but it was a painful past for Pony.

"I'm not a wizard. I didn't graduate."

The fact that she pointed out the fact meant that she still couldn't get out of the mindset of a wizard.

"I know. But I think it's cool."

She was a woman with a knack for making people comfortable.

"Hmm."

When Pony sent a signal of favor, Langi brought a chair and sat in front of her.

"You went to Alpheus Magic School, right? Then... you must know a person named Sirona?"

For the first time, emotion appeared on Pony's cold face.

"How do you know Sirona?"

"Haha, of course I know. Who in the world doesn't know the Star of the Ivory Tower?"

"Well..."

To the layman of magic, the Ivory Tower was an unfamiliar institution, but Pony felt a sense of homogeneity with her.

"What kind of person is Sirona?"

"What kind of person?"

Her eyes, which were recalling her school days, fell into deep sorrow.

"Actually, we weren't very close. We just exchanged a few words in the cafeteria. Rather, we fought more often."

"Wow, you fought with that Sirona?"

She felt somehow good.

"We were competitors at the time. But it was only after the graduation exam that it went wrong. Sirona was from a commoner."

Pony added.

"Of course, there is no such thing as status in magic. It's a world where you can prove yourself with just your skills."

Her fierce gaze calmed down again.

"Our family, that is, the royal family, made a mistake. They pressured me to pass and drop Sirona, who was the top student, for just that reason."

'Anyway, politicians...'

Is there a machine that makes the same thing somewhere?

"It was shameful. So I didn't go anywhere. The incident got worse. Eventually, I..."

Pony spoke bitterly.

"I decided to commit suicide."

Langi's eyes widened, and Miss Biden, who had been listening next to her, whispered in a hurry.

"Hey, what if you say that? There are so many ears listening here."

It would be a decisive blow if the disqualification leaked out, but Pony did not waver and continued her words.

"I tied a rope to the ceiling and hung my neck."

No one responded among the participants, but the sound of speech was completely gone.

"I pushed the chair away and entrusted my body to gravity. But at the moment I fell down, it stopped."

Langi swallowed her saliva.

"It was strange, so I slowly opened my eyes and looked down, and Sirona was holding my leg. He, who put me down, looked at me straight and said this."

Pony's words were extremely calm.

"It's not your fault, Pony."

Now everyone was looking at her.

"It wasn't a word I brought up to comfort me. It's really not my fault. I was talking about losing not only the top rank but also the wizard's license."

Pony still couldn't believe it.

"What kind of person is Shiro? Simple. A wizard. And the best wizard of this age."

"You still like magic."

"I wanted to do it until the end. But I want to trust myself a little more. I think that's the order."

Endless battles and competitions, a cold boundary line world where no one appeals to emotions.

But looking back, wasn't it the most comforting time in Pony's life?

"I miss it. School...."

For the first time, a smile appeared on Pony's lips and the competitors who were listening turned their heads.

'Well, I can't use that.'

If it's a dismissal, it will flow, but such a drama would rather enhance Pony's charm.

'The Dragon's defeat is the Grand Wizard.'

Langi still had the novel that Shiro had left at the hotel.

"Shiro is a cool person."

Pony laughed.

"Yes, when he was a wizard... honestly, I can't deny it either. But you'll be surprised if you see it in person. He's a perfect country boy."

Although the situation each understood was different, Langi seemed to know what he was saying.

'When he was a wizard. What would he look like?'

When Langi was immersed in imagination, the security team that had surveyed the surrounding area came back in.

The captain of the guard introduced Justin.

"This is a sniper expert who was urgently deployed this time. With this, your safety will be further strengthened, so you can participate in the competition with confidence."

There were few people who knew about the terror threat.

"What kind of sniper expert? Honestly, who would shoot us from afar? If you catch it, you might."

Justin said.

"There are not only male villains in the world. Please follow the control for full preparation."

"Ah, I don't know, I don't know! What kind of control is it to control eating, drinking, and even breathing?"

It was impossible to persuade because confidentiality was a priority.

"From now on, the world festival! The main round of the World Beauty Contest begins!"

As the host exited to the applause of the audience, the opening ceremony celebration performance continued.

"Maya, tension is poison, but don't let it down too much. Trust me. You can do it."

It was Maya's turn.

"Introducing! The owner of outstanding singing ability from Thormia, Maya!"

When she took a deep breath and stood alone where all the audience seats were visible, she felt dizzy.

'Let's calm down. I've done harder things than this.'

She tried hard to recall her magic school days.

'Yes, I'm not alone.'

The appearance of the performers arranging the instruments felt like the Shiro team who had fought together during the occupation of the base.

'Bomb Drum, Iruki.'

As soon as she arranged the major and the instrument, a smile came out.

'Hong An's keyboard Amy. Nate is perfect for an electric guitar. And the bass is...'

Shiro, who always held the center of the team.

'Someday... Can we play together?'

The prelude to 'Light Rain', which she wrote, flowed, and she felt the gaze of a thousand people focused on her.

"Hoo! I'm glad. I'm not late."

The moment Shiro, who arrived late, sat down, Maya slowly stepped and matched the beat.

"You're really cool, Maya. You've achieved your dream."

She couldn't hear Shiro's voice, but Maya's movement, which had been moving left and right, stopped abruptly.

"What, what? Why is that?"

Palmer, who was watching from behind the stage, immediately realized that it was not a normal situation.

"Shiro."

At first, she thought she was seeing a welcome, but the person sitting in the first class seat was definitely Shiro.

'Shiro really came.'

She couldn't hear the music, the cheers of the audience, or even the heartbeat.

"Phew! I'm glad. I'm not late."

The moment Shiro, who arrived late, sat down, Maya slowly stepped and matched the beat.

"You're really cool, Maya. You've achieved your dream."

She couldn't hear Shiro's voice, but Maya's movement, which had been moving left and right, stopped abruptly.

"What, what? Why is that?"

Palmer, who was watching from behind the stage, immediately realized that it was not a normal situation.

"Shiro."

At first, she thought she was seeing a welcome, but the person sitting in the first class seat was definitely Shiro.

'Shiro really came.'

She couldn't hear the music, the cheers of the audience, or even the heartbeat. <br>
