The world they live in (3)

Meanwhile, at the seats where the managers were, the head of the Baroque family and his eldest daughter Irene were also present.

"Irene, go back. This is a heavy matter. It's not something you should see at your age."

Irene was stubborn.

"I'm going to know everything now. And they're my escort, so it's only natural that I see."

The hunters gathered today are expected to be classified according to their skills and placed in the right place.

However, it was a well-known fact that skilled people were likely to become personal bodyguards of high-ranking managers.

'Didn't he come? Foolishly...

The person Irene was looking for was Lian.

'It's a chance to stamp our family. I was going to pick him specially if he came.'

She was unnecessarily upset.

"Huh?"

As she looked around with a disappointed heart, she found a familiar face from the security team.

'He's here!'

Lian was watching the interview from the top of the Colosseum.

"Uncle, no, brother!"

As Irene waved her arms above her head, Jennia, who was next to Lian, shouted.

"You son of a bitch!"

Without a chance to stop her, she kicked down the stairs and jumped into the Colosseum.

'I'll kill you!'

The image of her parents' bodies torn into dozens of pieces by Nike's whip was vivid in her mind.

'Because of you, because of you...!' She was also dragged into an unnamed laboratory and subjected to a terrible experiment that she could not dare to say.

"Yaaa!"

The moment Jennia swung her Dark Blade at Nike, half of the arena flew away with a thud.

"What...!"

Lian, who was coming down the stairs, shouted.

"Jennia! Back off!"

Perhaps the party didn't realize it, but Nike's left eye was wide open with the whip she swung.

'Great reaction speed. He's a strong guy.' It was even more eerie considering it was daytime dominated by the sun.

"Lian!"

Benoff blocked the front.

"Did you find the spy?"

Lian looked towards Jennia, but she was already hidden by many hunters.

'Damn it!'

He turned his direction and ran towards the place where the managers were with Benoff and said,

"There are two vampires. The assistant in the shade and the old man sitting in the VIP seat."

"Showbell."

If the head of the Zive Information Department was a vampire, any strategy would have been in the palm of his hand.

"I'll arrest him. You save your colleague."

That was the agreed upon thing.

"It's impossible alone. They are also Almas."

Because Lian's words were true, Benoff had no choice but to shut his mouth helplessly.

"Vampire! Kill him!"

The Colosseum was surrounded by hunters around Nike.

'It's a competition. If you show off your skills here...

You will surely receive the king's recognition.

'You're wrong, fools.' Jennia, who had been baptized by Nike and regained her sanity, gritted her teeth.

Being captivated by the public spirit meant that she was not qualified as a vampire hunter.

'Nothing can comfort us.'

Those who had nothing left but anger against vampires were rather keeping their distance coolly.

"Are you Nike?"

An old man with a goat beard approached next to Jennia, who was recovering her eyeballs with Blood Cure.

"The priest who handles the twin iron. They say he's the strongest Almas, but we have no chance even if we all attack."

"So... are you going to run away?"

"When I was seven, a vampire killed my mother."

The old man looked over seventy.

"I thought so even at a young age. It won't take more than 30 minutes to kill a person."

The old man, whose eyes were bloodshot and shedding tears of blood, looked back at Jennia.

"There's no place to run, is there?"

From this terrible hell of the mind.

"It's boring."

When Nike swung two whips at the same time, the air roared and the bodies of the hunters were torn to shreds.

"It's now!"

The hunters, who sacrificed the vanguard as a sacrificial lamb, all rushed to Nike with anger.

"No!"

Nike is strong.

"You're Silver Bone, right?"

The old man next to Genia pulled out a drug machine and gave a faint smile.

"Please live. I beg you."

Although he himself throws his body in anger, someone has to survive and finish off the vampire.

"Mom!"

With a scream that seemed to tear apart, the old man rushed with his eyelids wide open as if his eyeballs were going to fall out.

"Do not expect mercy without pain."

Two whips, each 3.8 meters long, moved as if they were alive and scratched the hunters.

"Cough!"

As if dozens of sawing were done at once, bones were torn and flesh splattered in all directions.

"It can't be."

Genia's shoulders trembled.

"Is there such a difference?"

Even in a situation where drug machines, firepower machines, and metal machines were all mobilized, they could not even hurt Nike.

'Fighting under the sun...

In fact, Genia, whose hood was peeled off, felt like she was inhaling fire every time she breathed.

"Haah."

Hot steam spewed from Nike's mouth as she turned her body and swung her whip.

"Oh God."

Every time this hot energy seeped into his lungs, he was deluded that he was alive.

"Do not forgive me."

Of course, if possible.

"Kill! Kill the vampire!"

Before long, the ground was covered with pieces of torn flesh.

"Your Majesty, it would be better to avoid the place."

While being guarded by Zive's guard 'Shinjang', King Meyer did not move a step.

There were too many eyes to see to run away because of a single vampire.

The high-ranking officials who knew this fact also kept their positions, but their insides were burning.

'Damn it. Let's just go in. If you leave the hunters to fight, right?'

The one who moves first becomes a coward, and the statics will attack this as an excuse after death.

The officials who found the king's face pale chuckled inside.

'Heh, you have Shinjang to protect you.'

Even if it's not a windmill, if it's a guard of the Seven Kings, they thought they wouldn't die.

"There is a lot of civilian damage. Send the 3rd Army to suppress it."

Whether he realized the officials' eyes, Meyer pointed to the Colosseum and gave instructions.

"But Your Majesty, if you disperse the troops...

"For those who came to help the kingdom. It's also a stain on my name to let them be slaughtered."

Unable to defy the king's command, the commander of the guard sent the 3rd Army.

"Capture the vampire."

When 20 armored men landed in the Colosseum at the same time, the ground roared.

"Ready!"

A posture with both legs gathered, slightly twisted waist, and hands holding the handle of the sword.

"Capture!"

While those who honed the technique of footwork analyzed the battlefield, the commander of the 3rd Army shouted.

"Charge!"

They disappeared from their seats at some point with their bodies tilted at the same angle.

"Attack!"

When the 4-stage chain that ends any enemy in one blow was completed, 20 flashes covered Nike like a vertical net.

"Krrrr!"

As the shape of the whip disappeared, the thunderous sound of static electricity took its place.

"That, that......!"

The officials watching from the Colosseum widened their eyes, and even King Meyer gasped.

"Can't you do it with Shinjang?"

20 guards, whose armor was torn like a tin can, were separated into blood and flesh and fell to the ground.

"Haah."

The battle entered a brief lull, and Nike lifted her head and spewed white smoke.

Just moving her hand 1 centimeter made the tip of the whip wriggle like an eel.

"Your Majesty! You must avoid!"

The commander of the guard felt ashamed, but the safety of the king was the top priority.

"Hmm."

Meyer stood up from his seat, unable to win, and the managers also headed towards the exit, subtly looking around.

Benoff shouted.

"Do not move! There's a vampire!"

In the midst of everyone stopping their actions, the head of the intelligence department, Shovel, jumped up and shouted.

"Block it!"

The aide who jumped out of the shadows blocked in front of Benoff, but his neck fell at Lian's blow.

'Surely they can't use their power during the day.' Nike was an abnormal vampire.

"Kyak!"

At Irene's scream, when he turned his head, the head of the Bark family was caught in Shovel's hand.

"Dad! Let go of my dad!"

"Shut up! Humans like..."

Shovel, who was released into dark smoke, flew towards Irene while holding the head of the family.

"Die."

Just before the impact, the great sword went through Shovel's heart and pushed out.

"Kuhuk!"

As the smoke gathered around the sword as if being sucked in, Shovel returned to his human form.

"Heup!"

Lian, who ran to where the sun was shining, stuck Shovel's body on the ground with a great sword.

"Kuaaa!"

As his skin began to burn rapidly in a situation where strong regeneration was impossible, he was exposed to both sides.

"Let go! Let me go!"

Even though he scratched with steel-like nails, the Idea did not even have a scratch.

"Brother! Come this way!"

When the eyes of the managers who had dealt with two Almas in an instant were focused on Lian, Irene quickly took over the conversation.

Lian looked back at the Colosseum.

"Genia."

She saw her fighting, sucking in the blood cube among the many hunters shedding tears of blood.

Even with her right ankle broken, she was running, tapping the ground with her bones, and she looked noble.

"Take the princess and avoid it."

The head of the Bark family nodded his head.

"No, you go with us. Protect my daughter. I'll give you as much as you want for the reward."

The one who took Lian was a power holder.

"Brother, you're going to protect our family, right? Right?"

Lian looked back at the managers who were watching him with hopeful eyes.

"From what?"

"Huh?"

Now I knew.

'What it means to be strong.' What is truly strong.

'They are the ones who are fighting now.' Anger.

"What I have to protect is only one." My anger inside.

"I haven't lost anyone yet...

Because I was not born as a god.

"I'm always angry."

Only that anger paralyzes fear, and makes humans fight with higher things.

"Kueuuuu!"

Lian, who bit his teeth, felt a surge of blood in his heart, and his anger grew endlessly.

'Yeah, this was it.'

What I was looking for while crossing the desert was the source of emotion that could collapse Imer.

'I don't care what happens now.' I wasn't afraid of anything.

"Now, you."

A few strands of Lian's hair stood up, and then his shirt exploded like an explosion.

'It's not a human body.'

The muscles of Lian, which were thought to be perfect, twisted like a baguette and interlocked in a strange shape.

" Haaaak......

The incarnation of anger, Lian, who transformed into the body of Yacha, twisted his upper body while trampling on the ground.

'The law of power.'

The right to face Nike stretched out.

Transcendence of God - Heart Power Maha.

Shovel, stuck in the Idea, felt the tremor of the law and screamed.

"Dodge!"

What Nike saw when he turned his head was......

'What is this?'

The scene where the landscape of the world is crumpled towards one point and is being pushed in.

'Can I... avoid it?'

The law of power came faster than the most pessimistic prediction, and Nike's body exploded in a circle.

"Kuaaa!"

Hundreds of bats flew out from the roundly cut body and spread out in all directions.

Bang! Bang Bang! Bang! Bang!

The energy of Maha blew up the wall of the Colosseum and made an invisible tunnel as it moved away.
