Seong-eum and Sambo looked at the vast crater as if a meteorite had crashed.

"That place...."

It was the center of the labyrinth, Jessica.

"It seems something has crashed."

The reason for Moon-gyeong's serious voice was because the size of the crater was beyond imagination.

'But I can't see the crashed object. What on earth fell?'

Volcano's leader, Ziggs, muttered.

"Ymir's tooth."

Seong-eum, who had annihilated Volcano, had set up a guide station, but it was his first time arriving at the center.

However, there were stories that came down like legends.

"According to rumors, Jessica is said to be an area where Ymir's tooth crashed a long time ago."

"A tooth? Are you saying that such a pit was dug by the crash of a mere tooth?"

It was a crater that reached a diameter of 2 kilometers.

"Your Highness, according to ancient documents, Ymir is a giant that has absorbed more than 10,000 bodies. If a tooth is pulled out in a giant state, the mass will also be quite large."

Ziggs laughed dryly.

"You're misunderstanding something."

Moon-gyeong looked back with an unpleasant expression.

"Misunderstanding?"

"Do you know about heaven? The liquor of the episode is a liquor method that melts humans and makes giants. And Ymir is an unprecedented giant who has reached the 10th stage of the episode's liquor. Do you know what that means?"

Seong-eum asked with an indifferent attitude.

"What does it mean?"

"The number of humans involved in the episode's liquor is roughly 8 to 10. Then, such giants gather 10 people and are born as the next stage of giants. According to this calculation, the number of humans needed to reach the 10th stage of the episode's liquor is...."

Ziggs raised one finger.

"It means it reaches 10 billion."

"10 billion...."

Moon-gyeong couldn't imagine Ymir in her head.

"That's the king of giants, Ymir. I'll leave aside how he integrated the minds of 10 billion people, but the number itself is unbelievable. Even if it's not in a giant state, if a tooth of such a being crashes, it's my judgment that a pit of this size can be made at any time."

Seong-eum was lost in thought, resting his chin.

"If so.... what kind of incident was it that pulled out such a person's tooth?"

"I don't know. Maybe someone from before history had a real fight with Ymir."

Ziggs looked around the vast crater.

"As you know, giants are given the right to leave for a new world from the moment they pass the 6th stage. The reason is because they can manipulate the telomere level from then on."

Moon-gyeong recalled the secrets of the Jincheon Universe.

"Partialization and gigantism."

"Yeah. A 6th stage giant can create a new individual with a part of its body. Also, if you exhaust the telomeres to the extreme, you can transform into a giant. The average height of a 6th stage giant is 80 meters, but if you activate gigantism, it approaches 2 kilometers."

It was information that was not inferior to the Jincheon Universe, which devoted its life to studying giants.

"The strange thing is that from the 6th stage onwards, the average height actually decreases. We call this condensation. It's a phenomenon where the power gets stronger as the size decreases. Volcano estimates that Ymir's condensate will be around 3 meters at most."

"A giant of 3 meters made of 10 billion humans?"

"Perhaps Ymir, who had fought here a long time ago, was not as big as he thought. In fact, I don't even want to think about it. It makes me realize how small a human being is."

While Moon-gyeong kept silent, Seong-eum raised his head.

'From that high place....'

In the real sky before the artificial sky was created, Ymir must have fought with some being.

'The power of a single tooth.'

In the meantime, a tooth was pulled out and crashed here, and it seemed that everything would have been swept away by the shock wave.

That's how the civilization disappeared, and the giants built a pyramid in that place and were honoring Ymir.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

Sung-eum lifted her chin and said, "But don't worry. No one in this world can enter my day."

Sung-eum, who had escaped from the flashback, moved again.

"The candidates competing with me are not easy. If they risk their lives in the competition, there is no danger that I should avoid."

Unable to break Sung-eum's stubbornness, Moon-gyeong followed with a sigh, and Ziggs also entered the crater with Sambo.

The pit with a diameter of 2 kilometers was hundreds of meters deep just by depth, and the pit was narrow like a funnel.

'It's small. Unless something really small hits with tremendous power, such a pit cannot be created.'

Ziggs' shoulders trembled as he watched the spectacle of the volcano hypothesis being revealed as a fact.

"Where on earth is Ymir's tooth..."

At the moment Sung-eum muttered, the crater vibrated roughly and the soil from the east, west, south, and north began to be sucked down.

"Don't come near."

While Sung-eum stopped the party, four huge statues rose from the place where the ground was sinking.

"That's an ancient weapon! Princess, it's dangerous!"

Ziggs stopped Moon-gyeong.

"Wait! That's Yul! It's the gate of the test! If you get close, we will be caught by the law too!"

As there is a name called Hera in the law of angels, in heaven, the law of giants is called Yul.

-You who have reached here.

The four statues that slowly rose finally left the ground and floated up to a height of 10 meters.

Their faces, looking down at Sung-eum in a fetal position, resembled beasts, and long horns were embedded in their foreheads.

-Are you a being crossing the universe?

The sound made by shaking the iron body seemed to hit the heart directly.

"If you ask if I'm a giant, I'll say no. But if you ask if I can cross the universe...."

Sung-eum covered her mouth with her sleeve and laughed.

"Why can't I do what you guys can do?"

-...Prove Yul.

A powerful flash popped out from the long horns attached to the four statues and hit Sung-eum.

"Princess!"

Sung-eum's body, which could not avoid the activation of the law, was wrapped in light and floated up, then spewed out a tremendous flash.

"Huh!"

A tremendous shock rushed into Sung-eum and blew her consciousness to the far side of the universe.

'Here is....'

The planet she lived on was only a moment in sight, and soon the scenery of the universe filled with densely packed stars in the dark darkness unfolded.

'I'm flying endlessly.'

In the inertia of consciousness moving away at the speed of light, Sung-eum realized the horror of a massive scale.

'Compared to the vast universe, humans are also just dust.'

A vast distance that feels like you can never return to the original world.

'And this is....'

Sung-eum, wrapped in Yul's flash, stood up vertically and her lips like petals slowly opened.

"This is my step."

Ether Wave-Inferno.

From the far side of the universe where Sung-eum bounced off, space was crumpled and rushed towards the main body.

"Princess...."

At the end of her confirmed step, Moon-gyeong trembled her shoulders and shed tears of emotion.

'The step of the real sound is across the universe.'

You will never be able to approach her.

"Is it done now?"

As soon as Sung-eum landed, the four statues that had been silent went down through the floor.

At the same time, something white quickly popped up from the center and fell in front of Sung-eum.

Ziggs shone his eyes and shouted.

"Ymir's tooth!"

Sung-eum, who hates touching other people's bodies, watched from a distance by fixing the space.

A single tooth, small enough to be believed to be human, was shining in the artificial sun.

'It's a big deal! The legend was true!'

If it's a giant like Ymir, you can create a new entity with just one tooth, so Moon-gyeong hurriedly drew her sword.

"뭐지?" translates to "What is it?"

After a while, Ziggs gave his opinion when there was no response.

"Emir is the only one in the army of heaven who can choose the battlefield. Perhaps his will is preventing rebirth."

"Hmm, it's bland."

When the wounded pride threw a molar, Ziggs hurriedly caught it with both hands.

"La Enemy is not here. It's a pity, but there's nothing we can do. Let's move on."

The strategy of exploring all three labyrinths from the beginning was only possible for Jinsung Eum.

"Ha O Myeon, where are you going?"

In terms of distance, Andre was closer, but it was meaningless to the star-jumping Sung Eum.

Sung Eum looked beyond the horizon and said,

"I'm going to see Shirone."
