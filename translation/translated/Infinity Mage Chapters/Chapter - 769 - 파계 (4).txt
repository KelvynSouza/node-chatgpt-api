[769] Breaking Away (4)

* * *

The main house of Wigo was a massive temple built on a prairie 14 kilometers away from the capital, Gardan.

Apart from Dongbang Jungcheon-dong, a sacred place for monks, it was the place where the most practitioners in the world stayed.

However, most of them are currently participating in the Zion Project, so the temple was quiet when Sironne arrived.

"Wigo?"

Wigo's cousins, who had received the signal that the president of the Magic Association had come, flocked in.

"What's going on at home? And who are these people?"

When the Chief Justice of Terraphos judged all of humanity, the number of good people was less than 1% of the total population.

The fact that they could not enter Zion was evidence that their cultivation had not yet reached the extreme good.

Wigo introduced himself.

"They are the stars of the Ivory Tower. This is Saint Arian Sironne, and this is Saint Mirak Minerva."

"Arian Sironne?"

To the relatives of the Sky family who supported Wigo, Sironne was a very painful name.

"A very great person has come. What is the reason for the five great saints at the top of the world to come to such a shabby place......"

Before the atmosphere overheated, Garcia explained.

"Wigo asked for a lesson. Can you lend us a place to spread the fire god technique?"

The faces of the cousins turned red.

'Finally, I got a chance. Great, Wigo.'

Miro didn't think of Sironne as a disciple, but it was an undeniable fact that she had once taught her.

If he suppressed Sironne with the fire god technique here, he would be able to regain the title of the world's best structure family.

'It's not just Wigo's fault.'

Sironne, who read hostility from the eyes of her cousins, realized where Wigo's twisted lump had started.

'There is no teacher here.'

It is impossible for the head of the family, Cassia, not to know the heart of his son, but even so, he took everyone and left for Zion.

To protect humanity from demons.

'Thank you.'

Sironne's eyes changed.

'I will correct Wigo.'

The cousins retreated with pale faces.

"Uh! What, what is it?"

Even if the cultivation is shallow, the Sky family, they couldn't help but feel the coldness as if their hearts were frozen.

Yahweh's warmth was lifted, and Sironne was a perfect magician in the eyes of Garcia, a first-class magician.

'Is this really a weak magician?'

Just like absolute zero, the thing called a pure spirit was the extreme cold.

"Huhu, how about it? Isn't it amazing?"

Minerva stood next to Garcia.

"A terribly pure and terribly cool spirit. Isn't it the mental state that all magicians dream of?"

"......I understand Wigo's heart."

I wanted to feel it even once.

"What it feels like to be unshaken by all stimuli......"

"Give up, it's comfortable. After all, a magician should be like that. He's much more handsome than when he was Yahweh, right?"

Garcia shut his mouth at the nonsense.

"Let's go. I want to finish quickly."

When Sironne's voice vibrated the Spirit Zone, Wigo felt his heart freeze.

'Chet, what? I'm just intimidating.'

The infinite magician who mastered all the magic of the world.

If you collide with a pure spirit, you can't match it.

"Let me say it again, it's a duel of fire god technique. Using magic on each other......"

"I know. Guide me to the place of the duel."

Wigo turned towards the training ground.

"Follow me."

When he cast a fly spell, Sironne and Minerva, Garcia and the cousins followed him.

'Heung! It's just showing off!'

The place where Wigo arrived was a vast vacant lot where he could concentrate on the fire god technique.

There was no wall visible to the horizon, and this was also a place specially supported by Nama Emond.

"Come on, come on! We're here, so let's start quickly!"

Minerva, who cheered with applause, looked at Garcia and asked.

"You're really not going to bet? You can't do it because you can't bet on the promising future of your country, right?"
[Translated block]


"We don't gamble on other people's pain," Garcia said firmly.

"But if it's just asking for an opinion, I'd like to raise Wigo's hand."

"Ho ho ho! Pride lives on."

"…Really?"

It's not to belittle Oh Dae-sung's skills, but Wigo has spent his life fighting in a virtual maze.

'The avatar created in this way.'

The reason there is no eternal winner is because the latecomer can analyze and absorb the best.

Today was the day Wigo's efforts bore fruit.

"Physical attacks are prohibited. The game is decided only by the battle between avatars."

There was no need to worry at the level of the two, but the shock to the mind was considerable.

"Got it."

As Shiro Ne unfolded the sequence, the avatar of the light angel soared up as if to pierce the sky.

Wigo's cousins opened their eyes wide.

"Wow."

The scenery was eerily wavy due to the influence of time, and it was about to get seasick.

"It's cool."

Now Wigo, who had bared his teeth, unfolded his avatar with a blatant sneer.

"Then I'll show you my weapon."

As the sequence unfolded, a dense smoke like white paint sprouted from Wigo's shoulders.

"Heavenly Knight."

The smoke that rose to the height of the light angel turned into a knight covered in white armor.

It was a sleek form that seemed to focus on mobility, and the surface of the armor was smooth as if it had been coated.

She was slender enough to be a woman, and she held a nine-meter-long rapier in both hands.

'It's big, but it's clear. It will take considerable power to break it.'

The Sky family, who have been studying the realm since birth, were most confident in the sequence.

"How about it? It's an avatar called Heavenly Knight. I don't think it's embarrassing to face Oh Dae-sung."

To facilitate the battle of avatars, Shiro Ne moved more than 300 meters away from Wigo.

"…Let's start."

Wigo, who ignored to the end, frowned and unfolded his avatar.

"You won't even be able to follow it with your eyes!"

The 20-meter-tall avatar was dizzying just by approaching in an instant.

'It's over!'

The moment the Heavenly Knight crossed the swords in an X shape and cut the neck of the light angel, Shiro Ne took a deep breath.

"Phew!"

This is up to 1 second.

The surroundings of the light angel distorted rapidly, and before he knew it, he was floating higher than the Heavenly Knight.

'Angel's Punishment!'

When a beam of light rushed towards the wide back of the Heavenly Knight, Wigo's eyes widened.

'I already know!'

The front and back of the white-armored avatar reversed, and it flew straight towards the light angel.

'Dump!'

The side of the Heavenly Knight bent in an impossible trajectory and avoided the Angel's Punishment.

While a powerful shock swept the ground, countless rapiers flew in and stabbed the avatar of the light angel.

"Kuk!"

Shiro Ne's forehead narrowed.

"This is not the end!"

The white armor that makes up the Heavenly Knight collapsed completely and attacked the light angel in a form that transcends imagination.

"…It's quite an avatar."

Minerva, who had been watching with a cold expression like a snake, blew out a long puff of cigarette smoke.

"The collapse of form is the collapse of logic. So, can you print out the thought itself?"
[Translated block]


"It's a law called Dump."

Garcia said.

"Wigo can output everything he thinks through a celestial knight."

That's the law.

"Even if the time bomb expands the present, the reaction itself is nothing more than a result after the cause. But the dump is..."

"The cause and effect are output at the same time."

"That's right."

It was possible if it was not physics but spirit, and the manifestation of its unique personality was incarnation.

"To jump over the maze?"

Wigo's psychology was not in the heart of Minerva, but it was the first fact that came to mind when she saw the celestial knight.

'The position of the observer who accepts and understands all angles of the world, that is the heavenly hand of the maze.'

On the other hand, the celestial knight was the position of divergence that Wigo expressed towards the world.

"I think the incarnation that reveals the temperament of the Sky family is not inferior to the stars in terms of depth."

"Hmm."

Minerva snorted, but it was the only response she could make to Garcia's words.

'I win! I'm winning!'

The celestial knight showed what it was like for logic to collapse and thoughts to be output in their entirety.

It was never beautiful.

But because it was completely away from human aesthetic sense, it was the most functional form in the universe.

'Do you want me to tell you what's really scary?'

If it's just a dump, it could be ridiculous depending on the level.

"The thought of the sky fills the sky."

The celestial knight attacked the light angel in a form that blocked all trajectories where it existed, even the variable of time.

There were so many thin swords stuck in the body of the light angel that there was no more place to poke.

"Kuuuuu...!"

A groan leaked from Shiro's mouth, and cold sweat was dripping from his forehead.

"Is the reason for enduring pride?"

The celestial knight pulled out the thin sword and stepped back.

"It's disappointing. It would have been a beautiful sight to admit it if you knew you couldn't win."

"Yeah. You're really strong."

Shiro slowly raised his eyes.

"If I admit defeat here, are you satisfied now?"

"Don't talk nonsense."

The celestial knight stretched out many thorns, revealing Wigo's anger.

"Where do you dare to make an excuse to escape?"

Looking at the form of Unrocker's thought pouring in all at once, Shiro clenched his teeth.

'It's more twisted than I thought.'

I didn't intend to do it moderately from the beginning.

'I'm sorry, Cassia...'

From now on, it was an area where even the confrontation of incarnation could not guarantee Wigo's life.

'It seems there's no other way.'

When I first realized this, I thought I wouldn't use it except for Nene.

'The punishment of the angel!'

The light angel thrust the spear.

"It's useless!"

As Wigo's thought was output, the celestial knight avoided the spear of light in a bizarre form.

'Here's 1 second.'

The light angel, made up of time gears, changed its shape rapidly as it went through the stages of paper, mouth, and resonance.

'And this timeline...'

Shiro gritted his teeth and activated the incarnation technique.

'Bounce off!'

Light Angel's Incarnation Technique - Time Vibration.

"What...!"

Even in a moment that could be called the minimum unit of time, Wigo's thought was formed by finding a gap.

'Why is it coming again?'

The more incomprehensible fact was that the punishment of the angel was flying in again in this short moment.

'Dump...'

When he managed to avoid the 3,000th spear, Wigo realized what this was.

'The same time is vibrating.'

The past time is still the beginning of the moment.

'How long...'

At the point where the repetition of 1 trillion was 6,281 times, Wigo's thought reached its limit in a hurry.

'I don't know anymore.'

The moment he let go of the string of cognition that he had been pulling tightly, time flowed according to the standard of the five senses.
