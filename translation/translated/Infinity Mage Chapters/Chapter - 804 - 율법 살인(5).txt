"Law Murder (5)

"Where are you?"

As the wire hanging on the skeleton's finger wobbled, Natasha's speed increased even more.

"There, the right passage."

Natasha's Smudo, worn on her arm, read Crouch's line of sight through the sterile time.

"He's gone far. What's there?"

"Nothing. He's just trying to get as far away as possible. Maybe this could be dangerous."

It was clear that there was a specific intention they didn't know about, as they were moving away from Habitz's apartment.

"Turn left here."

Natasha, who turned her body at a right angle, ran down the long corridor.

"It's a trap."

"Maybe. But it's not a trap for us. It's something we have to check."

The place they arrived was the underground dungeon of Marsak, the yellow star, and it was a dead end on the last floor.

"He's here."

Crouch greeted them with a severed neck in one hand.

"How can you be alive with a severed neck?"

Natasha spoke as if it was amazing, but Smudo realized the seriousness of the situation.

"What are you up to?"

The severed neck opened its eyes sharply.

"Nothing. I'm just looking for a place to die."

"Really?"

Smudo said.

"Catch him. Never kill him."

Natasha's body disappeared as if it had evaporated, and she appeared holding Crouch's face.

Whooosh!

Just that caused a strong wind to blow in the underground dungeon.

'I can't win in a head-on confrontation.'

Knowing Natasha's skills already, Crouch willingly turned his face.

"It's interesting. But how do you kill this?"

As Natasha lifted her face to eye level, Crouch's mouth corners rose.

"I see I didn't say this."

At the same time, the neckless body rushed in one step and stabbed Natasha in the abdomen.

"I needed a companion on the way to the afterlife." The unique power of the dagger Crouch was holding strongly pressured Smudo's sterile time.

'Is that an object?' Suddenly realized.

"Damn! It's a 'Law Killer'!"

In a room full of perverted tools, the rough breaths of a man and a woman heated the air.

Even while exchanging deep kisses, Alphapis, Abella, couldn't hate Habitz.

'I can't. If this goes on, the mission... To her, assassinating Habitz was not a desire, but a homework.

"I'm going to start now, sir."

When she pushed Habitz's chest, he fell flat on the bed, which was red like blood.

Abella, who climbed up Habitz's body, pulled out the chain armor hanging on the iron bars and put it on Habitz's left hand.

"S’ w

---,----?

Habitz chuckled as if it was fun, and Abella kissed him lightly and teased him.

'This time, the right hand.'

The sound of the iron chain scraping was heard.

"Keeeuu!"

Crouch shivered at the solid sensation felt through the handle of the 'Law Killer'.

'It's like stabbing a rock.'

He definitely aimed at the heart, but her muscles were holding the blade like a stone.

"Do you not die because you're a doll?" Natasha, as if she didn't care about the blade in her abdomen, pulled Crouch's face closer.

"No, if that's all, it's enough to destroy the doll. You, you have multiple lives, right?"

Even though Crouch was stabbing with all his might, the dagger was still more than half pushed out.

"In the end, you're weak. If you were strong, you would have used the same method as me."

Natasha was also a doll, but she was confident that she would not be destroyed.

"How many? It's not infinite. If you die this time, will you come back to life? Shall we experiment?"

As she asked and looked into Crouch's eyes, Natasha smiled as if she had realized something.

"Is it the last?"

Smudo said.

"Natasha, don't be reckless."

The 'Law Killer', rated as the worst weapon of mankind."

'Legal murder. This is not the problem to solve here.'

It was the first time seeing it with my eyes, but considering the brutal history contained in the sword, I had to approach it seriously.

"Answer honestly. What are you decorating? What is my hatred contained in the 〈Law Murder〉?"

As Crouch remained silent, Natasha's arms swelled.

"Krrrr!"

Crouch's head, which was caught in both hands, crumpled like a balloon with a loud noise.

'The facial skeleton is steel, but it's monstrous strength.'

There is no such thing as the limit of physical ability to Natasha, who is under the control of the fire god.

"Smudo, what should I do? It seems like I can't feel the pain. Then I can't torture."

"No. This is enough."

Smudo made a decision.

"Just stay like this. 〈Law Murder〉 changes the law. Nothing will happen as long as it is embedded in your chest."

"Ah, is that so?"

Despair was contained in Crouch's eyes.

"Stay here. I'm going to talk to Balkan. If Abella is...

Ding. Ding. Ding.

The moment Smudo turned his body, the bell rang from beyond the wall, signaling midnight.

"Hehehe."

Crouch's mouth was grotesquely torn.

"I won."

Smudo shouted.

"Natasha! Kill!"

As soon as the words fell, all of Natasha's fingers stood up, and as if squeezing out juice, Crouch's head broke.

'Good muscles.'

At the end of his life, Crouch twisted the handle of the sword with all his might.

'It's perfect muscles.'

Because it was a muscle hard enough to bounce off an arrow, the sword broke with a clang.

'It's not a person who kills.' Everything is according to Crouch's script.

'The situation kills.'

Crouch's body fell down, and Natasha only then touched her heart.

"Smudo, the sword is...

The blade that had been embedded disappeared into the air like a phantom.

"What? What law is it!"

The effect of 〈Law Murder〉 is well known, but Minerva was the only one who knew the detailed function.

Since there is nothing to change by shouting at the already dead, Smudo turned his body and left the underground prison.

"I have to tell Balkan!"

Natasha caught him like a swallow and sprinted.

"Is the preparation over?"

Abella's heart ached at the voice of Habitz, who was excited like a naughty boy.

Ding. Ding. Ding.

Then the bell rang for midnight.

'It's the start.'

As if he had been under a weak hypnosis, as soon as he heard the bell, his murderous intent boiled up.

"Yes. All preparations are over."

Abella, who had restrained Habitz's limbs, stood up with his waist between her legs.

"Hehehe, a woman who climbed the emperor. So... what are you going to do now?"

"You'll know if you wait."

Abella's voice was cold, but Habitz thought it was a game and nodded his head.

'The bell rang.'

In any way, Crouch disappeared.

'〈Law Murder〉 is...

By stabbing Natasha, the target changes and the user's hatred will be reset.

'It must have broken.'

The 〈Law Murder〉 that Crouch risked his life to destroy will find the closest user who hates the target...

"Sir."

It will come into Abella's hand.

"I'm sorry."

Abella, who was holding the 〈Law Murder〉 upside down, looked down at Habitz with cold eyes.

"It's not the play I thought."

Clear murderous intent was embedded in Abella's eyes.

"I know you've done a lot for me. You got me out of the fate of a witch, and I was able to open a pretty shop...

The tip of the sword trembled.

"But you've killed too many people so far. And in the future...

"Rest."

Abella, who flinched her shoulders, looked down and Habits slowly nodded his head and said.

"If you thought so, that's what you should do."

Abella felt a huge fear.

'What am I doing now?'

If walking on a tightrope is an adult, it was a feeling of falling towards infinite freedom when that tightrope was cut off.

"I'm going to kill you!"

"I know. That's what you want to do."

No.

'It's not what I want to do! Because you're a bad person, so you have to die...

What I really want to do is.

'I don't know. I don't know what to do!'

Who is Habits, and do I really have the right to kill this person...

'Who gives that right!'

What happens to the world if Habits is killed.

'I don't know anything!'

Perfect chaos.

Abella, who had deviated from the law for the first time since she was born, shivered in vast freedom.

"Your Majesty!"

With a bang, the door opened and all four Gustav machines stormed into the room.

Everyone lost their minds at the sight they couldn't believe even though they imagined it.

"Balkan."

Habits turned his head.

"Didn't I tell you not to come in? Today is the day for Abella and me."

"What are you talking about? You seem to be dying soon."

"Get out."

Habits looked up at the short sword again.

"When I die, Abella is the emperor. Let her do whatever she wants. It would be nice to make the whole world a flower garden."

Zetaro shrugged his shoulders.

"Puhit! That's hilarious! A flower garden."

Balkan also had no reason to say to his best friend who wanted to spend the night alone with his wife.

"I understand."

As soon as he turned his body leaving a short answer, the remaining three followed.

The door closed.

'What? Did you go? Really?'

"Abella."

Abella, who was surprised, turned her gaze.

"Do whatever you want if you want to. It's something I've wanted to do for you since a long time ago."

"Huh??????

Abella's eyes were hot.

"Why, why are you good to me? You've killed so many people! But why are you only doing this to me!"

"Because we're friends."

The reason was simple.

"Sometimes when you have too much fun with your friends, you kill and die."

Something that had been making up her until now broke off in Abella's head.

"Black! Black!"

Without holding back the falling tears, she spread her upper body like a bow and raised the short sword.

"Uaaaaaaaa!"

With a scream that seemed to tear, she crouched down with all her strength and the law was deeply embedded.

Habits didn't even blink.

The short sword that was stuck in the bed started to vibrate roughly as soon as it passed by Habits' ear.

"Kuk!"

As soon as Abella took her hand off, the law was destroyed.

'Why, why?'

Kashan, Aganos.

"Woorin."

When Minerva turned the Gando and opened the door roughly, Woorin, who was holding the fragments of the porcelain doll, appeared.

"……You couldn't come back."

Gando didn't even plead for her this time.

"I was thinking of retiring if there was one left."

"If you kill Habits, what will happen to the world."

'I don't know anything!'

Perfect chaos.

Abella, who had deviated from the law for the first time since she was born, shivered in vast freedom.

"Your Majesty!"

With a bang, the door opened and all four Gustav machines stormed into the room.

Everyone lost their minds at the sight they couldn't believe even though they imagined it.
