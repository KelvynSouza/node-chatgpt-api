[631] What's Really Important (1)

The Fire Mist heated the air and the Fire Strike poured towards Pisho.

'I can't cast insect magic anyway!'

As Pisho, who deals with creatures, his abilities were limited in areas where toxic gas spread.

'The one thing that bothers me...'

It was the grotesque insect attached to where Pisho's right arm should be.

'Is it a parasite?'

If it detoxifies the gas by wearing a gas mask insect on its face, the insect connected to the body should also be able to withstand it.

"It's useless, Amy."

Pisho was unshaken, even after being hit by several Fire Strikes.

'It's an ability I've never seen before.'

If it's a creature parasitizing the body, there was no problem with the assimilation judgment.

'Then I'll cut it off!'

Kieeeee!

As Pisho's arm stretched out, Argones popped out of his open jaw.

"That's about it!"

It was an easy evasion for a Schema user, and Amy, who approached Pisho, struck down his arm with a sword.

It was a force that could break bones, but surprisingly, there were no bones.

'What the, what exactly?'

The moment she felt a squishy sensation, Pisho grabbed Amy with his other hand.

'Are you trying to wrestle?'

Amy, who twisted her two legs and pulled up the rotation, punched Pisho's abdomen, and the fist went through the stomach with a thud.

The creepy sensation made her hair stand on end, but Amy made a cool judgment.

'I have to blow up the heart!'

The hand that dug into the stomach and went in grabbed Pisho's heart, but all she felt was a squishy sensation again.

"I am no longer human."

The moment she heard Pisho's emotionless voice, Argones bit Amy's back of the head.

"Huh!"

"Don't be afraid. Because you passed the test."

The fist that was in the stomach slipped out, and the expression disappeared from Amy's face.

"As my faithful servant."

The alien creature Argones.

This creature, first reported in academia 230 years ago, is believed to have flown on a meteorite from outside the solar system and boasts a strong vitality that can maintain life even when breaking through the atmosphere.

The creature, which kneads the host's cells and changes the body into a completely different biological material while maintaining the appearance, is predicted by academia to have a considerable number of humans infected with Argones.

"You... you..."

Amy desperately moved her stiff tongue.

"Indeed, it's amazing. You're still conscious even when you're infected."

Argones, a parasite in the host's body, infiltrates the pilot insect into other creatures and seizes the central nervous system.

'No. I lost control.'

She kept backing up her self-image memory, but her body didn't move as she wanted.

"Don't struggle. It's just painful for you."

As if a child blindly trusts his mother's words, her body automatically responded to Pisho's instructions.

"What... what did you do... to my body."

When Pisho raised his right arm, the shape that had been kneaded like dough gradually returned to that of a human.

"Lifespan is ultimately just a function created in the process of cellular evolution. Argones, which has no average lifespan itself, maintains biological activity forever by integrating with the host's body."

It was a kind of immortality.

"But it's just theoretical."

Pisho lowered his powerless arm.

"Human bodies that have stopped cell division continue to accumulate errors, and I too will eventually become a vegetative person covered with cancer cells."

That was the fate of humans who accepted Argones.

"Don't worry. It's not like you're going to become a monster like me. I'll extract it when the test is over."

"Just... to pass... the test..."

"I just donated my body for the advancement of biology. I'll go into isolation when the graduation test is over."

Someday, cancer cells will spread to the brain and burn out, but Pisho's intellectual curiosity was strong enough to overcome it.

"Let's go, Amy."

Captivated by the genetic urge to obey, Amy slowly turned and followed behind Pisho.

"Shirone..."

Shirone, kneeling in front of Maya who was crying with tears and snot, touched her forehead.

"It's too hard... I want to stop now..."

People in the world revered magicians, but Maya, who had lived with them, was sick of the word magic.

"Everyone's crazy. If I stay any longer, I think I'll go crazy."

Shirone also knew that it was a world that could not be endured with a normal mind.

"Not much is left. Just a little more..."

"I can't do it. I can't think of anything anymore, not the tribe, not my siblings."

Maya closed her eyes tightly and sobbed.

"I just... want to love you a little more..."

Maya wouldn't be able to bear it.

"Finally... to sing... I tried hard..."

Looking at Maya, who was convulsing, Shirone made a decision.

"Let's go, Maya."

The combination of Luman's anthill and Fjord's toxic gas was not a bad situation for Shirone, as it would weaken the mental strength of competitors.

'I can't love you, but...'

When he focused his mental strength, which had recovered somewhat for free, the incarnation of the archangel bloomed and aimed the spear outside.

'Elysion!'

The sense of directness pierced the anti-magic and detected Luman's location outside the anthill.

"I can give you one more chance."

Divine Punishment of the Angel.

As the spear of light pierced the inner wall and escaped from the anthill, Luman's eyes widened.

"What!"

The moment he screamed, the flash had already pierced his torso and passed.

"Cough!"

- Participant number 16. Exited from the two thousand system.

As Luman lost consciousness, the anthill disappeared as if it was crumbling, and the trapped participants quickly looked around.

'Darn, Luman was hit. I just had to hold on a little longer.'

If he had dragged on for about 10 more minutes, there would have been a dropout, and it would have been an easy graduation situation.

'Maya! What about Maya?'

Cayden was only thinking about Maya, and when he found her in Shirone's arms, he made an expression that he couldn't understand.

"Why...?"

On the other hand, Iruki quickly grasped the situation.

"So that's what happened."

He made Luman drop out to save Maya.

'A clear emotional judgment. If that's also the privilege of the strong, there's no problem to argue...'

He wanted to graduate together, so it was true that he was sorry.

'Are you really okay? This time, you clearly shook hands.'

Shirone slowly put Maya down.

"That's all I can do for you."

"Shirone..."

He couldn't analyze as accurately as Iruki, but he could feel that Shirone had sacrificed something.

"Just try a little harder. So you don't regret it later."

That alone made Maya feel like she had everything.

"Phew, I'm tired."

Shirone, who moved his steps to the participants with a broken neck, slowly raised his hand and made a gesture to rush.

At the same time, Cayden rushed with his cross sword raised.

'I couldn't protect Maya!'

The moment Shirone widened his eyes and tried to take the attack, Cayden immediately passed him and ran to Maya.

"Taha!"

When he blocked Maya's front and twisted his body to raise his sword, Richard's metal arm bounced off with a clang.

"Darn!"

In a situation where graduation is guaranteed if only four more people drop out, it was common sense to aim for Maya, and Richard didn't like Cayden's judgment that broke that common sense.

"Is the test not in your mind? You're a crazy guy too."

"I don't want to hear that from you."

He didn't want to hear the word crazy from a human who had modified 35% of his body.

'If only Maya can be happy...!'

He had long surpassed such things as jealousy.

'I can be unhappy as much as I want!'

Magic Sword Skill - Mega Tornado.

Richard, who was thrown into the air by the strong wind, quickly regained his balance and spotted Maya with his mechanical eye.

'Maya must be eliminated first!'

As the Magic Stone of Flame was equipped, it spewed fire, and Kaiden swung his cross sword towards the pouring flames.

"Yaaaaaap!"

As the cold wind blew and extinguished the flames, Richard's right arm rotated 45 degrees and equipped another attribute.

'That's right, this is it!'

Even while doing so, the other participants were focusing their attacks on Shirone.

'Surely the reaction speed has slowed down! We are winning!'

The fact that she was so exhausted that she couldn't even spread the Force Dimension was being analyzed through the eyes of the scouts.

"Her mental strength has dropped to 4 percent since defeating Luman. Is this the end?"

Baikal was also sorry.

"It's the price of emotional judgment. That's why wizards need to be cool-headed."

Amy, who had abandoned her long-range sniping skills, was pouring out a six-shot attack with her red eyes blinking incessantly.

'Is she being controlled by something?'

The fact that the backup speed of self-image memory was not normal added to the suspicion, and then Amy spat out words.

"Stupid Shirone."

"What?"

She couldn't even stop her thoughts from jumping out as a voice because she had lost control of her body.

"Do you value Maya more than the graduation exam?"

"That's......!"

When Shirone, who was creeped out by the blatant words, stepped back hesitantly, Iruki flew in with a click of her tongue.

"It's self-inflicted. Why do you sympathize with that?"

The chain explosion of Atomic Bomb attacked Shirone, and Sabina fired Wind Cutter into the explosion.

"Kuuuuuu!"

In a situation where it was burdensome to maintain the Sibulsangpokmae, the mental strength began to drop continuously.

"Waaaaaaaa!"

When Shirone, who had overwhelmed the competitors so far, was in danger of being eliminated, the cheers of the audience were louder than ever.

"Very sadistic......"

Baikal said.

"It's pornographic."

Elizabeth couldn't deny it.

"There's nothing more fun to watch than talented people who have devoted their lives to one path hitting their limits and despairing."

She had watched many competitions as a scout.

"Talent, effort, or wealth. If you give up a little bit of anything, all of humanity can be happy right now. But that has never happened in history. So I think it's not that they don't, but they can't."

"On the other hand, that competitive spirit has also advanced humanity."

"Of course it would. What I want to say is......"

What she really wanted to know was.

"Why do we need to progress if everyone is happy?"

What are we fighting for?

"Of course, I also climbed to this position through competition. So the 27th judgment is the worst. It's just that sometimes, I can't even think about what's really important."

'This is not it!'

Amy, who had set her red eyes on fire, broke free from the mental control of the parasite and poured Fire Strike all around.

'Was there a place I couldn't reach?'

She felt a deeper realm that the hand of domination could not reach in Amy's mind.

'How dare you humiliate me?'

When Amy, who had entered the first path, heated up her cells with the land of fire, Elizabeth shouted.

"Her body temperature has exceeded 42 degrees! It's dangerous at this rate!"

'She's trying to extract the pilot insect.'

Since it had already settled in the human environment, if the heat rose sharply, it would not be able to stand it and would come out.

'But she could die. Does she really want that?'

'Get out! Get out of my body!'

Even though her mind was hazy, her self-image memory found the pilot insect that had taken over the central nervous system and concentrated heat there.

Seriel jumped up and shouted.

"Amy! You can't do that!"

Even if she defeated Shirone in the human heat that was hot enough to kill bacteria, she had to risk a high probability of death.

'Even if I defeat Shirone......'

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
