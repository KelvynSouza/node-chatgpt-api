[788] Calm Zone (1)

As soon as they arrived at Aganos' airfield, the Kaidra breeders had already prepared Latusa.

Iruki, who came to see off Shirone, handed over his friend's bag and said,

"How long do you think it will take?"

"Depending on how much the Arachne government cooperates, the time will vary. But it won't take long."

If it's Ivory Tower, they have no choice but to cooperate, and it was also the reason why Uorin specifically pointed out Shirone.

"The problem is Betapischi, real name Emery Justin's thoughts. Maybe... she might not hate Habitz."

Iruki was also worried about that part.

"She's the only survivor while the whole clan is dying. There is enough room for fear to work more than hatred."

The fact that she had abandoned her name and was hiding in a foreign country also added strength to the evidence.

"I'll try my best to persuade her, but if she doesn't like it, I can't help it. Like Ms. Abella, the 'Law Killer' is not a weapon that can be forced."

"Right. We'll also prepare a countermeasure."

Anyway, if Shirone's sincerity did not pass, it was impossible to bring her no matter who persuaded her.

"It's not a dangerous mission, so calm down and come. Arachne is a world-class resort. You've been having a hard time lately."

Recently, Shirone's face was noticeably emaciated.

'The battle is a battle, but...'

It must have been a tremendous mental fatigue to clash with the demons who hate Yahweh terribly.

"I'll be back."

There was no thought of a vacation, but Shirone didn't show it and boarded the Kaidra.

"It's been a while, Latusa."

As a comrade who crossed Noscata together, Latusa rubbed his beak happily.

"If Kaidra gets tired, take a good rest. You don't need to feel pressured because of us."

Shirone pulled the reins and said,

"It's okay. If you're tired, I'll carry you and fly."

Latusa stood up and a huge shadow was cast, and Iruki's gaze went up to 4 meters.

"Let's go!"

The massive body of Kaidra, who threw herself out of the airfield, fell vertically.

Kiyaaaaaaaa!

Immediately, a clear cry of a strange bird burst out, and Latusa revealed herself again and disappeared into the clouds.

"......She says she'll carry you and fly?"

Iruki shook his head imagining the sight of Shirone riding a strange bird on her back.

Arachne Kingdom.

5-star Rubistro Hotel.

"Maya, are you ready? Have you seen the sheet music for this song? Isn't it amazing?"

Maya arrived in the Arachne Kingdom three days ago.

"Yes, it's really good. It's exciting and cheerful."

The concert planning company 'Elbor' in the Thorumia Kingdom paid special attention to the debut of a large newcomer named Maya.

So, it was the opening stage of the biggest festival in Arachne, the World Beauty Contest.

"That's right, that's right. It's the result of the collaboration between the best composer and the best lyricist."

Every year, an average of more than 20,000 tourists from all over the world flock to see the World Beauty Contest.

Palmer, a handsome bachelor in his mid-30s, the representative of Elbor, shook his fists.

"The timing is just right. Due to the damn demons, the scale has been reduced a bit this year, but the press articles from each country will be spread all over the world. Don't worry, just sing well."

"Representative."

Maya frowned and said,

"I know you're doing really well for me. I'm really grateful."

"Hahaha, what did I do? I just caught Maya's innate singing ability faster than anyone else......"

"It's really good, the song is good and everything is good......"

Maya was agonizing because she knew Palmer's favor, but no matter how she thought about it, she was not confident.

"The lyrics are weird. I can't sing like this."

"Huh? Lyrics?"

Maya spread her arms and shouted.

"It's too decadent!"

"Hmm."

Palmer blinked his eyes and recalled the lyrics, then obediently nodded his head.

"It's a bit provocative. But that's why it's good? If it's not blatant, it's always a hit if it's erotic."

"Of course, Maya. I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll find a new lyricist who can better match your style and what you're comfortable with. In the meantime, let's focus on your strengths and continue to improve your performance. Remember, your comfort and confidence are key to delivering a great performance."

"I should have known that it was burning with personal desire.

"But it also means that it's a material that even veteran monsters choose desire over money."

"If you can use even a dull appearance as a weapon, it would be good to try it as Maya intended."

"Okay, let's go purely."

Maya asked anxiously.

"Do you think you can complete the lyrics in time with only three days left?"

"We'll have to mobilize all the company's manpower. It's rare to find someone who can pick as sensibly as a monster, but...:"

There was no regret about that.

"Then can I try writing it?"

"Huh? Maya, you?"

"Yes. Actually, I don't know what the two thoughts Mr. Monster talked about are, but I still want to try."

"Hmm. That's not bad."

Relying on Maya's original appearance was one of the strategies since the lyricist had fallen anyway.

"Okay, work on it for now. I'll put it up for final review. But you have to practice consistently, right?"

Maya smiled satisfactorily.

'Shirone.'

There was a lyric she wanted to write.

Kiiii!

The strange sound of Kaidra woke up Shirone's morning sleep.

"Huaaam!"

The air, which was cold before going to sleep, had already changed to the warm heat of the equator.

"Wow!"

Tens of thousands of lights were floating on the surface of the doldrums as if the sun had broken.

Forests and cliffs blended into islands, scattering colorful birds into the sky like fireworks.

"It's a wonderful place."

Shirone nodded her head.

"But the mission comes first."

Shirone, who had passed through the 10 kingdoms of the archipelago from the east one by one, said goodbye to Latusa in the sky of the Arachne Kingdom.

"Thank you. I'll buy you something delicious when you arrive in Kashan."

Kiiii.

Shirone, who stroked Kaidra's head, threw her body before it was too late and fell to the ground.

As she descended towards the capital 'Bengal' of Arachne, she heard the crowd and the sound of music.

"It's a festival."

Unlike Minerva, it was not in her nature to rudely enter the walls of the fortress, so Shirone landed on the building.

Because everyone's attention was captivated by the festival, no one noticed the stranger who fell from the sky.

"This is the Arachne Kingdom."

It was the third island located in the 10 kingdoms of the archipelago stretching east from the southern continent's coastline.

'The natives who crossed the sea from the south by boat long ago are the beginning of Arachne.'

So, despite the development influenced by the advanced civilization of the continent leading the civilization, the customs of the south remained.

"Shall we go down?"

When Shirone jumped down to the alley and came out to the main street, open carriages were parading.

Arachne dancers in bikinis were shaking their hips, and the host said.

"Ladies and gentlemen! It's Miss Yakma!"

When the representative of the Yakma Republic, who participated in the World Beauty Contest, passed by, everyone's attention was focused.

"Miss Yakma! Show me your face!"

The protagonist was hidden behind the curtain, and the silhouette waved her hand at someone's request.

"She waved at me! I love you! I don't know who you are, but I love you unconditionally!"

People burst into laughter.

"Miss Tormia!"

Shirone's gaze naturally turned.

'It's our kingdom!'

Again, only the silhouette was visible, but the woman with her hand on her knee was elegant.

'I wonder who it is? I'm really curious.'

The curiosity that everyone had was to be solved on the day the World Beauty Contest was held.

"Miss South Emond!"

The host's voice embroidered the southern sky.

"Let's go."

Shirone, who had landed on the building, jumped down to the alley.
