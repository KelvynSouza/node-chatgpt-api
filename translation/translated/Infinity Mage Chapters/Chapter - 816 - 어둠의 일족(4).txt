Tribe of Darkness (4)

The hideout of Genocide was a small cabin in the forest beyond the walls.

It was a cozy place with firewood burning from the fireplace, but as we went underground, a fortress decorated with neat machinery came out.

There was a passage leading to the weapons warehouse, and on the other side, the engine room was visible.

"Welcome. Did you get the job done?" A woman with oil on her face came out opening the door of the engine room.

She had her red hair cut short like a man and wore a dirty towel around her neck.

"Oh, who is this person?"

Genia did not believe what was uncertain.

"I don't know yet. I met him on the way. Where is Mr. Grain?"

"He's in the medical room. It seems he has developed a new drug."

As we entered the end of the corridor, there was a medical facility crowded in a space larger than the cabin.

A white-bearded, scruffy doctor who was looking into the microscope turned his chair.

"You're here, our assault captains."

Dr. Grain.

He was a doctor affiliated with Genocide and a clinical trial expert who knew everything about vampires.

"A new face appears. Surely... it's not a vampire?"

It was a common joke, but this time the reaction of the party was not very friendly.

"That's why I brought him. This man, he's called a knight of Maha. Of course, it's self-proclaimed."

"Ho? Then it's even more suspicious. Beating 10,000 demons is not the realm of creatures."

"Stop talking nonsense and check it out. Can a human whose heart has stopped come back to life?"

Grain looked back at Lian as if asking for an explanation.

"What are you talking about?"

"In fact...

Since he had heard about a man named Grain on his way to the hideout, Lian also expressed his curiosity.

"Hmm, if you hear the hallucination of Smiley, the wound regenerates. Even from a state of death."

"Yes. Now it seems I've forgotten how to die."

Grain nodded.

"It's an unusual thing. But it's not a special phenomenon. Immortality is originally a characteristic of creatures."

"Do you mean you don't die?"

"What is death? You don't say that a stone died because it broke. Creatures also came from inorganic matter. If you go back to the original creature, there is no concept of death there."

Lian was silently listening.

"But why couldn't it evolve into an immortal body? It's because of the virus. Small things that exist at the midpoint between living and non-living infect specific information."

Grain hit his palm with his fist.

"Do you understand what I'm saying? If you don't try to change the information, you will be extinct by the virus. There is a limit to defending with mutations alone. So creatures have borrowed a unique method of information combination. After creating new information through the combination of male and female, discard the existing information."

"That's death."

"As long as the virus exists, old information must be discarded and new information must be produced endlessly. Animals also hate incest for this reason. The combination of old information does not help fight the virus."

Grain pointed at Lian.

"The hallucination of Smiley, your grandfather also heard it. But you don't know who Smiley is."

"Yes."

"You might know. Even if it's not in your memory, it could be engraved in your genes."

"Genes?"

"The more you enter the world of particles, the more you realize that there is no analog in this world. Life is also nothing more than a collection of information at the minimum unit. In my opinion, your current manifestation may be very old genetic information that responds to certain stimuli."

Genia asked.

"So if that information is activated, you won't die?"

"Possibly. As I said earlier, death is not originally a function that life had."

Lian asked.

"Is it possible to bring out the information recorded in that gene in my head?"

He wanted to know.

"Interesting. But it's not impossible. The more you go into the world of particles, the more you realize that there is no analog in this world. Life is also nothing more than a collection of information at the minimum unit. In my opinion, your current manifestation may be very old genetic information that responds to certain stimuli."

Who was the owner of 〈Idea〉, and why did Imir know the agent?

"I don't think it's impossible." Grain stood up from his seat.

"Because the hallucinations you hear are also memories at the genetic level infiltrating your mind. But if you want to go into more detail, you need a complicated process."

"A complicated process?"

"Genetic information is not human language. But the brain is a perfect interpreter. If a specific stimulus evokes memory, you can try changing the direction and intensity of the stimulus."

Grain was an expert.

"It's probably not an area that a living thing can handle. No matter how much regeneration is done, the pain is real. So, how far have you experienced?"

"Well, I've definitely experienced my heart stopping." As he turned to look at Genia, she shrugged as if she believed now.

"Have you ever had your neck cut off?"

"I've never been completely separated." Grain shivered his lips.

"If I experiment with you, I'll start by cutting your neck first. Because I want to know the limit of recovery."

"I've had my brain broken, but Grain shook his head.

"It's strictly different. The body is a combination of essential functions that cannot be said to be more important anywhere. Because what is not essential has already become extinct. It's a dangerous attempt if you don't have experience. You wouldn't want that either."

He wanted to know about Smiley's hallucinations, but he couldn't die in vain.

"I still... I think I have something to do."

"That's right, it's the last resort. Stay here and try this and that."

Lian asked.

"Then what about vampires? Did they also activate immortality at the genetic level?"

"No. Rather, it's the opposite." Grain turned to Lian.

"Strictly speaking, they are not creatures. It's a virus. It injects specific information into humans to control them, or absorbs their information to regenerate the body. Everything follows the mechanism of the virus. It's a half-dead existence that is neither a creature nor a non-living thing."

"Did the virus evolve?"

"No. It was originally a creature." Grain's thoughts went back in time.

"A long time ago... a bat that realized the incarnation and had a human body."

It was an old story.

"Like any other human, he was obsessed with immortality, and eventually he got immortality. But he wasn't satisfied there. Even if the number of individuals is infinite, the extinction of the individual cannot be prevented. That's why I can't cut your neck."

A creature can be destroyed by some powerful force.

"He wanted to exist until the end of the world. Then he went back to the origin of life and found the most efficient way."

"A virus."

"That's right. Half-dead. He was able to become a virus that never dies in exchange for giving up half of his entity."

Grain's eyes were filled with flesh.

"That's the beginning of a vampire. The current Ten Lords rank 3, True Demon Faust Marilse."

"...You know about heaven."

"I don't know in detail. What I know is the information I got while tracking the genealogy of vampires. Faust, who gained true immortality, naturally lost his reproductive ability. Instead, he injects a special prion from his fangs to make him obey."

"Are you talking about pure blood?"

"The true demon stayed in our world and injected three humans. They are the lords who rule vampire society."

Grain drew a genealogy in the air with his fingers.

"The Lord created dozens of Almas ranks, and Almas created thousands of Beshika. The further down the genealogy, the further away from the true demon. But one day, someone in the Beshika rank caused a mutation."

"What kind of mutation?"

"He gained reproductive ability." "The Beshika, who fell in love with a human woman, slept with her and had a child. Surprisingly, that child also had the characteristics of a vampire. We call them half-demons. But the pure bloods call them this."

Grain raised his finger.

"Hybrid."

Jenia's face darkened.

"Many hybrids have spread in the world. So many different crossbreeds that can't even speak, like werewolves. Of course, breeding between half-breeds was much more common." Grain glanced at Jenia.

"In the process, a mutant with abilities impossible for even pure-blooded vampires was born."

"What kind of...?"

"Just as a virus has its own wavelength, vampires also have a special wavelength. An ability has been developed to accurately detect that wavelength and track its location."

The biggest reason why vampires couldn't be eradicated was that it was difficult to distinguish them from humans.

"That's an amazing ability."

"Right. That's how vampire hunters were born. The characteristic is that they have silver hair from birth. So we call them Silver Born."

Only then did Lian turn to look at Jenia.

"Huh, what?"

Grain said.

"Right. Jenia is a Silver Born. Although her skin burns in ultraviolet rays and her ability to detoxify silver is extremely low, her body regenerates through blood and she has physical abilities comparable to a vampire." Then a woman from the engine room, Engineer Paset, came into the medical room.

"But she eats human food instead of blood, and she also has reproductive abilities. And she doesn't have the incarnation of a bat."

One of the vampire's abilities, the incarnation of a bat, was generally passed down from the true devil Faust.

"Paset, is your work done?"

"Counting bullets is not a job. Anyway, we made some money on this case, so we increased the proportion of silver in the alloy. The paralysis effect will increase by 10% compared to the original."

Pauer hit his fist.

"Uhaha! I want to shoot it quickly! I'm dying to see the expression of the vampire who got hit!"

Paset reached out to Lian.

"Nice to meet you. I don't know what's going on, but it seems like the misunderstanding has been cleared up. I'm Engineer Paset. I modify firearms."

"Firearms?"

Drug expert Catein said.

"There are three main ways to deal with vampires. Firearms, drug machines, and metal machines. They all dig into weaknesses."

Paset continued to explain.

"We use silver in firearms. Because it slows down the recovery of vampires. Drug machines use a drug called Anti-cell that Grain made. And in metal machines..." Jenia pulled out a dark metallic dagger.

"Obsidian. Made with an alloy containing ObscuraB."

"Obscura means..."

It was a material that went into video recorders, and it was a product handled by the state because of its rarity.

"Vampires can't penetrate ObscuraB."

Paset said.

"It's incredibly expensive. It's a mineral that only occurs in a super-cold dark room, and it can't be made even with alchemy. So we don't dare to use it in firearms, we use it in metal machines. If you're a good swordsman, it's much more efficient than firearms."

Jenia smiled a smile that was hard to see.

"What effect does Anti-cell have?"

"It basically coagulates blood and destroys cells. Vampires are defenseless against cell-level attacks."

Grain held up a syringe.

"But to deal with them, you need to prepare a lot. If you get hit by the power pack I developed, you'll get an analgesic effect and your muscle strength will increase. The enhancement of the nervous system also increases agility."

There must have been side effects.

"Does everyone fight after getting that?"

"No, Jenia is an exception. There's something much more efficient for half-breeds."

Jenia took out a thin mechanical device.

"Blood Cue (Menthol)."

It was a tool that steamed blood with heat and inhaled the steam.
