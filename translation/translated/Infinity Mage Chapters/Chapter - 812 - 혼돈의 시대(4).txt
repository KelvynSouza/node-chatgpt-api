Age of Chaos (4)

"Let's get started!"

Benop, who had checked the flesh by tapping on the guard, began to attack in earnest.

Unlike Jap, it felt like a hammer was flying and hitting, and Lian's upper body trembled while being buried in the ring.

'Schema.'

It was quite a level.

'Can't you do it properly?'

Meanwhile, Benop's fists were raining down on the guard.

'It's like an iron wall.'

Even if he had set up solid subordinates, if he had hit like this, the bones would have broken and he would have written a death sentence.

"That's it!"

Benop's leg came up to his head.

"Just break it!"

When the shock came from the side, Lian's body swayed and was pushed along the line.

'The guard is open.'

Benop detected the shock and went in, but Lian's fight was just beginning.

'It's starting to boil?' The numerous practical techniques he had learned while fighting with the demons were hidden deep down.

'Let's see

The next morning.

Comparing the bed of the security officer and the underground lump of the desert would be a breach of etiquette, but Lian's eyes opened early in the morning.

When he went outside, the morning chores were over and the guards who couldn't see were sitting in their places.

"You woke up early. Has the hangover eased a bit?"

Security Chief Benoff had no day or night.

"Yes. We have to leave early."

"You said you were going home. Is there anything else left to do?"

"No, not really...

He was curious about the whereabouts of his family.

"I see. I'm sorry, but I have to say something that will hold your ankle. This is also a favor, can you help me?"

"You're talking about the serial murder case."

"You heard it, you're quick to talk. Follow me for now. Let's talk on the way."

Heading to the morgue, Benoff spilled a story that was no different from what he had heard from the guard yesterday.

"Ordinary people are forbidden to enter, but I trust you, so I'll show you. This is it."

When the coroner stepped aside, Benoff pulled out a handle that looked like a cabinet.

"Hmm."

Lian's face twisted.

"Do you have a feeling?"

The corpse, whose blood had dried up and shrunk completely, looked like a mummy, and its mouth was wide open.

It was indistinguishable whether it was horror or ecstasy.

"Vampire."

Benoff nodded his head.

"It's a strong suspect. In fact, it's not that there haven't been reports of vampire attacks in Zive. But this time it's a bit unusual. They don't suck this much blood."

It was not normal in Lian's thought either.

"Even if a vampire uses blood as food, wouldn't there be a limit to the stomach? That's why it's ambiguous. Maybe it's a human who pretended to be a vampire."

"If it's a human, it's definitely a pervert."

"That's right. Even the royal family is beginning to realize the seriousness. But I want to solve it with my own hands. It's not a conscience, honestly, I have to smash this guy."

"It could be a vampire. Because they need a lot of blood if they are gluttonous."

It was not a denial.

"I keep both in mind. If it's really a vampire, it's going to be a big deal. If it's a pure-blooded vampire, it's not enough for the security forces. It should be about the 'kidney' of the guard."

Benoff knew why he was asking.

'Vampire...

There was nothing else to do except go home, and the vampire was also a demon.

"I understand. If I can help."

Benoff patted Lian's shoulder.

"Ha ha! I knew you would. Wait for me to prepare a temporary seat in the department. You probably won't be sitting at the desk anyway."

Lian unpacked his luggage again and sat in the seat designated by Benoff for a few hours.

The call came after lunch.

"Get on the carriage. I have a place to go in a hurry."

Benoff's face was not better than in the morning, but Lian got on the carriage without grumbling.

The place they arrived was a mansion that could be seen as a plutocrat at a glance.

It was not as large as the Ogent family, but it was too large to be built in the center of Zive's capital.

"Here?"

"Zive's first class, Bark family. When I reported the knight's case to the top, I got a call."

"Is it related to the vampire?" It was disgusting to be dragged around for political reasons.

"It could be, or it could not be...

The butler opened the door.

"Please come in. I have received a special favor from the lord. The lady is waiting."

As soon as they entered the mansion, a teenage girl was standing with her arms crossed, escorted by knights.

"Ah, what! I have to shop today! Why can't I go out?"

It was Bark Irene, the only daughter of the lord.

"Lady, don't you know? Due to the recent horrific incident, it is recommended to refrain from going out...

"That's why I can't go out even during the day? Dad is really too much!"
