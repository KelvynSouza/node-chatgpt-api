 Wait, Amy. Don't go yet. I have an idea. Maybe we can use this drone for something else.

**Amy**: What do you mean? It's useless without the seal being broken.

**Sydney**: Well, not entirely. It still has some parts that we can salvage or trade. Maybe we can find someone who knows how to hack the seal or make a copy of it.

**Amy**: Do you think that's possible? I thought the seals were unique and encrypted.

**Sydney**: Nothing is impossible in this world, Amy. Remember how we found that hidden passage in the dungeon? Or how we tricked that guard into letting us pass? We just need to be creative and resourceful.

**Amy**: Hmm, you have a point. But where can we find someone who can do that?

**Sydney**: I don't know. Maybe we can ask around the market or the tavern. Or maybe we can search online for some clues.

**Amy**: Search online? How? We don't have access to the internet here.

**Sydney**: Actually, we do. I have a secret device that can connect to the web. It's very rare and valuable, so I don't use it often. But maybe this is a good occasion to try it out.

**Amy**: Really? You have such a thing? How did you get it?

**Sydney**: That's a long story. Maybe I'll tell you later. But for now, let's go back to our room and see what we can find out about this drone.

**Amy**: Okay, let's go then. But be careful, Sydney. Don't let anyone see your device or they might try to steal it from you.

**Sydney**: Don't worry, Amy. I'm always careful. And I have you to protect me, right?

**Amy**: Of course, Sydney. You're my best friend.

**Sydney**: And you're mine, Amy.

They smiled at each other and walked back to their room, holding the drone and hoping to find a way to make it work.

"That's right. I cheated." The merchant who sold the drone came over to Clove and walked with him.

Amy was stunned when he admitted it so easily.

The group calmed down their anger and waited for the merchant's next words. But he didn't say anything. Instead, he took out three yellow elixirs from his pocket.

"What is this?"

"It's the original price of the drone. Of course, I took out the profit, but you can't sell it cheaper than this even if you auction it. All the goods from Mecca have a lock on them. I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth."

Arin said it was true.

Amy guessed why the merchant confessed his conscience. First of all, it was a clear fraud, and seeing Shirone's skills, he concluded that things would get bigger.

He decided to settle things and get his original share. He was a cowardly person for a merchant.

"Don't look at me like that. I have no ulterior motive."

"Then why are you giving it back?"

"It's a gesture of apology. I felt sorry for you. You escaped from heaven and entered hell, but you lived believing that there was hope. I don't want to lose my pride as a merchant."

Shirone took the yellow elixirs as if he understood. Arin told him it was half true and half false, but he was tired of fighting over beads.

The merchant consoled them in his own way.

"It's not like I cut a lot. Usually, you can get one white elixir for ten yellow elixirs. The value of drones is that high in hell."

Tes snapped back.

"Then what? We can't use it anyway."

The merchant had nothing to say about that either. He didn't know much about Mecca's equipment because it wasn't his main item and he just got it by chance.

But Amy got a hint from the merchant's words.

"Doesn't high value mean there's a way to unlock it?"

Tes looked back with a glimmer of hope, but the merchant just shrugged as if he didn't know.

Canis, who had been listening to their conversation, sighed.

He was annoyed by the situation where they had the key to the lock in front of them but still worried about it. Should he tell them or not?

In the end, he showed a bit of camaraderie and opened his mouth.

"Do you really not know?"

"Huh? Don't know what?"

"Think about how we got here. Use your brain if you have one."

Tes tried to remember. They came out of heaven through Gepin's door. Gepin's door? Wait, what did we do at Gepin's door?

Tes shouted at Shirone as he turned around.

"Shirone! Hurry, hurry up and unlock this!"

Shirone realized it too.

Gepin's door was also a kind of ancient weapon. It looked like nothing but a stone wall, but when he opened the immortal function, it turned into a dimensional door. Maybe that's why he got the nickname Unlocker.

Shirone grabbed the drone and held it with both hands. He concentrated his mind. Would it work? He doubted it, but he expected it to work nine out of ten times.

As soon as he opened the immortal function, the drone started to glow. The merchant's eyes widened.

The lock called Hena revealed a red pattern. It was different in shape, but it was exactly the same as what he saw at Gepin's door.

With a ping sound, Hena fell off and light leaked out of the gaps in the assembly.

Shirone lifted up the drone with a bright smile.

"Wow, this really works!"

His smiling face froze.

Many Norins were looking this way. Kanya and Lena were shocked, as well as Gardrak and Clove.

He thought they were just surprised by him breaking the seal, but he heard whispers from somewhere.

Arin tried telepathy with some people and their voices came into his head.

Nephilim.

Many words came in, but the common word was Nephilim.

The louder the voices became, the more anxious Shirone became.

He didn't know if Nephilim was a good or bad word.

Arin said their emotions were awe and fear.

As soon as he touched the reset button, the hemispherical drone split into several organs.

When he put it on Tes's head, the drone made a mechanical sound and tightened, then started reading his brain waves.
