Labyrinth Jessica.

In the giant city divided into the final 10 stages, the true sound arrived at the boundary line of the 6th stage.

It was an achievement that could not be achieved even if the so-called organizations prepared for 10 years, and the 200 members of the Volcano Exploration Team who had preemptively occupied this place were hurt in their pride.

"Spread the encirclement! Don't give a chance for a counterattack!"

Their skills, which hold the highest human exploration record in Jessica, one of the three major labyrinths in the world, were undoubtedly the best in the industry.

"Princess! Danger... Kuk!"

The members of the three steps were scattered in all directions by the ten heat flash guns that were thrust down from the sky.

'Geez! Ancient weapons!'

The shoulder armor that Volcano is equipped with is an ancient weapon called a kit, a weapon that outputs a heat flash gun from the lens in the center.

'What's more annoying is the collapse of gravity.'

As nearly 100 members of Volcano flew around the sky and bombarded, the area was devastated.

'I have to find the princess! I have to protect her!'

The ancient weapons buried here were not primitive technologies like the Signa or Exd used by the citizens of heaven.

In the situation where phenomena that cannot be implemented with modern technology threaten the sound, Moon Kyung's heart was pounding.

Although she is evaluated as having the best combat power among the ivory tower candidates, her actual combat experience is tribal.

It was uncertain whether she, who had spent most of her life in Huangxing, could withstand the pros of flying and jumping battles.

"Princess!"

Moon Kyung, who advanced through the smoke, found the sound standing alone in the middle of Volcano's enemy line.

'How did she get there so quickly...?'

It was clear that she had jumped in herself, and it was a mistake.

"Now! Finish it!"

As 200 members who flew into the sky at once aimed their heat flash guns at the sound, Moon Kyung felt dizzy to the point of losing her mind.

'No! That's...!'

Moon Kyung, who had been following the sound all her life, knew that she had never faced an attack faster than her senses.

"It's over!"

At the same time as the executive of Volcano shouted, a calm light flickered in the eyes of the sound.

Ether Wave - Grand Curve.

"What, what is that?"

Like an object moving along a rail, the flashes naturally bent and rotated around the sound.

The sound slightly raised one corner of her mouth.

"...I'll give you up to two steps."

When she reached out her hands, the flash that was swirling grandly all gathered between her palms.

The landscape of the world was distorted as if the threads were tangled, and even the natural colors flickered.

"Ah."

In the entanglement of space that cannot be analyzed by human heads, Moon Kyung felt as if she had lost the direction of life.

'That's exactly... the princess's, the true sound's second step.'

You can never go in.

'No, anyone other than me is the same. It's not an area where humans can step on.'

"Fluctuation of the Grand Curve."

When the sound spread her arms, the particles of the heat flash gun began to seep into the landscape like osmotic pressure.

"Flee, flee!"

Although the leader of Volcano shouted, the members, including him, already knew.

'You can't avoid it.'

Because there is no direction in the space of sound.

"Keruk!"

When a strong heat hit the sky, 200 members evaporated in an instant without leaving a drop of blood.

"I have to leave one alive."

The sound reached out towards the leader who had lost control of the kit and was flying around.

When she grabbed his ankle and pulled him down, the leader's body slammed into the ground at a tremendous speed.

"Ugh!"

She approached him, who was writhing with a broken leg, and asked with a hidden expression.

"Tell me everything you know."

The leader glared at her with tears of blood.

Labyrinth Pytharos.

In the labyrinth where the laws of seven sins are layered with different densities, Nane arrived at the last layer.

"I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry!"

If any human hears the roar of the jaws, their mind will go out...

'Why do we suffer?'

They were once human too.

'If the exchange of pain and happiness is impossible, isn't there no reason to exist from the beginning?'

Nane never walked fast, but arrived at the end of the labyrinth before any other candidates.

The only exit of Pythagoras, the gate of extinction.

The moment I crossed that door, time stopped and only the eternal persistence of nothingness remained.

"Please take us too! Please end the pain of this pitiful existence! Please!"

Still, many jaws crawled to the floor and begged at Nane's feet.

They also knew what kind of existence Nane was because they had experienced all the hells of the 7th floor.

"Poor sentient beings......"

Nane looked at the jaws with a sad look.

"Are you human?"

The owners of the underworld guarding the gate of extinction came stomping with huge feet like a metal plate.

There were horns growing like vines at will, and the flesh of the muscles was burning as if to stimulate the lust of the jaws.

"Amazing. You haven't lost yourself even after going through all seven hells."

Nane reached out and gave an order.

"Demons, open the door and save the sentient beings."

Passing through the gate of extinction into the world of nothingness was the last rest left for the jaws.

"This door is not made by you."

The demons came blowing fire from their nostrils.

"But isn't this hell made by you?"

The jaws were startled and ran away, and dozens of demons surrounded Nane.

"There is no exit for you. You too, fall here for an eternity and become a jaw."

Nane raised her hand and curled her index and thumb roundly.

"Destroy Mara and save sentient beings."

The tattoo of the sword engraved on Nane's tongue burned in gold, and many swords of light were displayed around it.

Dharma-Tongue of Truth.

Nane is almost right.

Therefore, the sound created by her tongue, which has a car number of 99.999 percent, becomes truth.

"Color is space, space is color."

The sword of light manifested through swordsmanship pierces the essence of the opponent with the same intensity as the enlightenment obtained through the question and answer of the precept.

"Kuaaaaa!"

When the sword of light radiating in all directions pierced the demon, the red skin turned into ash and burned out in an instant.

"When you close your eyes, it's the end, it's the boundary of existence and nothingness."

Nane is almost right.

"Follow me, pitiful ones."

When Nane opened the gate of extinction, a space filled with only pitch-black darkness without sound or feeling was revealed.

"There...... Savior."

The jaws, who were following behind with tears of overwhelming emotion, knelt down at the same time and called Nane.

"If you go in there, everything disappears, right?"

"That's right. It's liberation from the pain of existence."

The jaws clasped their hands and begged.

"If this is the end anyway, can't you let me taste the meat one more time? Because it's the last......"

Sadness was in Nane's eyes.

'Obsession. Obsession with life.'

The gap between the momentary memory left after pleasure and the sensory emptiness as if such a thing had never happened is the karma of creatures.

'Can't you cut it off?'

Nane, who realized that the jaws could not cross the door, sat down and reached out.

"Eat."

The jaw, which was already drooling, trembled and bit Nane's finger.

"Well, it's the end anyway. Because this is the last......"

The jaws rushed in and began to brutally tear Nane's body.

"It's delicious! It's delicious! This is the best!"

The jaws, whose eyes were spinning, quickly digested Nane's body, and when there was nothing more to eat, they scratched their throats with their nails.

"I'm hungry! I want to eat more! I'm hungry!"

There was no one jumping into the gate of extinction.

"Close your eyes, it's over."

Nane, who was almost right, closed her eyes.

The jaws, who were scratching their throats, stopped moving as if time had stopped.

"Follow me, pitiful ones."

When Nane opened the gate of extinction, a space filled with only pitch-black darkness without sound or feeling was revealed.

"There...... Savior."

The jaws, who were following behind with tears of overwhelming emotion, knelt down at the same time and called Nane.

"If you go in there, everything disappears, right?"

"That's right. It's liberation from the pain of existence."

The jaws clasped their hands and begged.

"If this is the end anyway, can't you let me taste the meat one more time? Because it's the last......"

Sadness was in Nane's eyes.

'Obsession. Obsession with life.'

The gap between the momentary memory left after pleasure and the sensory emptiness as if such a thing had never happened is the karma of creatures.

'Can't you cut it off?'

Nane, who realized that the jaws could not cross the door, sat down and reached out.

The jaw, which was already drooling, trembled and bit Nane's finger.

"Well, it's the end anyway. Because this is the last......"

The jaws rushed in and began to brutally tear Nane's body.

"It's delicious! It's delicious! This is the best!"

The jaws, whose eyes were spinning, quickly digested Nane's body, and when there was nothing more to eat, they scratched their throats with their nails.

"I'm hungry! I want to eat more! I'm hungry!"

There was no one jumping into the gate of extinction.
