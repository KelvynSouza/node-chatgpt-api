[754] Doctrine of Evil (1)

The 48th military facility was a place where special experiments were conducted under the direction of President Igor.

As such, it was garrisoned by elite agents, and the commander was also a captain-level figure directly elected from the capital, Pasha.

Thump! Thump! Thump! Thump!

Every time they patrolled with a military knife hanging on their belt loop and boots with studs, people were terrified.

"You! Come here!"

"Me, me?"

When a soldier's eyes turned fierce, a man who was walking fine hurriedly ran over.

As soon as he arrived, the soldier's fist struck the man.

"Ugh!"

The man who fell to the ground without even knowing why he was hit didn't have the courage to look up at them.

"What a stupid kid. Even after seeing us patrolling hard, you don't pay tribute to President Igor?"

There was no such clause in the military law of North Emond, but there were over 300 clauses containing the content that the soldier is the law.

Something unpleasant must have happened, and if he resisted here, his neck would be brutally cut off by the military knife.

"I'm sorry! Long live President Igor!"

The man who got up quickly raised both arms towards the northern sky where the palace was.

"......Go."

When the soldier spoke with cold eyes, the man was glad that his neck was still attached and quickly moved away.

His partner, who had been watching from the side, asked.

"Why are you so low pressure today?"

"Not really. The kids have lost their fear. Since the altar opened. How can the discipline of a country stand like this?"

"Is the collection not going well?"

The 80 soldiers stationed at the 48th military facility were receiving a kind of service fee from 1,200 city residents.

"Recently, they've been making excuses. They say their daughter is sick or something. They've been putting it off day by day."

"Hahaha! You're unlucky. Well, if a child is sick, the parents' eyes turn."

"It's not a laughing matter. I have to send money to my hometown, but I spent too much at the bar this month."

His partner winked and said.

"Shall I get it for you?"

"Is there a way? They won't let it out even if they hit and break it. You know the commander doesn't like strange rumors from our class?"

"That's why the underdog is scary."

His partner shook his finger and pointed at the residents' area.

"Even if the daughter is sick, it's better than dying, right?"

Verdi, a twelve-year-old girl living as a citizen of the North Emond Republic, resented the world.

'Why......'

Even though she didn't know exactly what happiness was, she was sure she was unhappy.

Even in her delirium from fever, she had to cook for the soldiers who had been coming in since morning.

"So it's better to think carefully. You don't need to catch a kid, right?"

The soldiers were angry because they couldn't collect the money, and Verdi was miserable because her mother was beaten because of her.

'I can't be sick. I have to endure.'

The sound of hitting the table was heard, and soon after, her mother's torn scream was heard.

"Is this a joke now! Do you really need to see the end?"

'It's quiet all of a sudden?'

The thought was only momentary, and soon the floor became noisy, and the soldier's partner came in.

"Hey! I'm starving! When will it be over?"

"Please wait a little longer. It will be done soon."

Verdi, who hurriedly put the onion on the cutting board and cut the vegetables quickly, cut her fingertip.

"Ouch!"

While looking at the blood oozing from her finger and making a sad face, the partner stomped his foot.

"You idiot!"

The man who knocked Verdi to the ground checked the onion and frowned.

"Where is the sick one bleeding?"

There was a bit of flesh and blood on the cutting board.

But what caught his eye was a single knife next to the cutting board.

"Huh? This is...."

It was simple and rustic, but it was clean like new, and the purple sheen in the sun was not ordinary.

"What's going on?"

A soldier came into the kitchen.

"Look at this. He was hiding this. They all make the same sick sound."

As if he had just thought of it, his partner asked.

"What happened, did you get the money?"

"It's settled. He's bringing the money now. He should have done this earlier, but he's just beating around the bush."

"Hehe, I told you to trust me. Is it a pack of cigarettes?"

The partner who put his hand in the basket and picked up a potato said.

"We can't cook here. Eat this and let's get out of here."

The soldier, who saw the sprout on the potato, quickly rolled it up with the snap of his wrist.

"I won't eat it even if you give it to me. You eat it."

When the potato stuck to his hand with a slap, the partner who thought it was fun suggested.

"How about this? The loser of the catch ball eats it. And a pack of cigarettes."

The soldier took a receiving posture and said.

"Anytime. Throw it."

"Okay, here it goes!"

The moment he threw the potato with a smooth connection action like a player.

'Huh?'

The partner realized.

'Wait, I'm right-handed, aren't I?'

He caught the potato with his left hand.

"What was I holding in my right hand?"

Because he was immersed in thought, the knife that flew out of his hand with a full swing was stuck in the soldier's forehead.

"Cough!"

Verdi covered her face and screamed.

"Kyaaaaaaa!"

When the partner checked the soldier's condition, he was dead with his eyes half popped out.

"No, it's not. It's not what I did!"

He ran to Verdi.

"You saw it too! We were joking! Why did I catch the potato with my left hand? I'm right-handed, you know!"

Of course, because he was holding a knife in his right hand.

"I don't, I don't know! I don't know anything!"

She didn't really know, but the reason she screamed exaggeratedly was because of the guilt left in her unconsciousness.

"Verdi! What's going on? Kyaaaaaaaak!"

The mother who found the fallen corpse at the entrance screamed as she threw her bundle.

"He, he killed someone!"

"Stupid! That's not it! This is an accident! Why would I kill this kid!"

The partner who strongly denied it suddenly opened his eyes and pulled out the knife stuck in the soldier's forehead.

"That, that's right! You killed him! You can do it as you killed him!"

When he held out the knife, the mother retreated in fear.

"You can do it as you killed him! I'll take care of the aftermath! If this gets reported to the top, I'm done!"

Because it was the words of a person who threatened to kill her daughter, she just kept shaking her head.

"Just listen to me!"

He stepped forward with a frustrated heart, and the palm of the fallen soldier stepped on.

The moist feeling as if tearing the sole of the military boots made the partner's heart sink.

"Euk!"

As the stepping foot lifted again and the body was about to fall forward, some insight seeped in.

'I'll never die!'

It was something he realized not from reason but from instinct.

"Heuk!"

But the moment he saw the soldier's fallen eyes, his body stiffened again and his ankle twisted.

'I, I didn't kill him!'

He twisted his body to the side, but his arms and legs were already stiff and his body was falling to the ground.

"Cough!"

He fell in a bent arm posture, and the knife was deeply embedded in his neck.

"Kruk. Krrrrrr...."

Seeing him boiling blood in his throat and bulging his eyes, the mother tore her hair and wailed.

"Aaaaaa! Aaaaaa!"

"This is the &lt;Executioner&gt;.

A crime expert with excellent insight might notice the unnatural posture of the corpse, but in the end, no evidence remains.

"Why is this happening to us? What should we do now......"

It was natural to panic because it was a situation that didn't make sense even to call it a coincidence.

"I killed him......"

But strangely, Verdi's heart was calm when the object of fear disappeared.

"What are you talking about, kid? These people died in an accident."

"No, mom. To be precise......"

Verdi, with a lost face, approached his partner's corpse and snatched the short sword from his hand.

"You, you......"

Verdi looked back at his mother with a trembling lip.

"This knife granted my wish."

"Are you crazy? You have to keep your mind straight at times like this!"

"Think about it. If we have this short sword, we can live happily! No one will be able to bother us!"

It was unnecessary to know that it belonged to the top tier of weapons, the S-class objet.

"I'm going to get rid of everything. I'm going to punish those who tormented our family! No, I'm going to get rid of Igor!"

"Are you really crazy?"

Mom was angry, but Verdi was already fascinated by the power of the &lt;Executioner&gt;.

"Knife, you can do it, right? You'll protect us to the end, right? Our family from this hellish place......"

A man's voice was heard outside the door.

"No. That's enough."

The door, which was definitely locked, opened too naturally, and a person in a robe entered.

"Who, who are you?"

It was a moment of relief that it was not a military uniform, but the heart pounded at the calm appearance even after seeing two corpses.

'Death. And it's a fatal wound that can't be revived.'

Shirone, who concluded that it was certain, took off his robe and moved towards Verdi.

"I came to get the short sword. Won't you give it to me? It's not something you should have."

Verdi's eyes became fierce.

"Who are you to ask for this? You don't seem to be from here, so leave before I report you!"

Except for the port city Dormica, foreigners were not allowed in any area of North Emond.

"Already two people have died. It's better to give it to me before more people die."

"They deserved to die! They hurt our mom... and me......!"

Tears welled up in Verdi's eyes.

"I can't give it up! If I don't have this, I have to live in hell again! No, I won't give it up!"

"The name of that short sword is &lt;Executioner&gt;."

It felt like it was taken away just by knowing the name.

"It's hard to explain to you, but it's like magic. It distorts causality and induces murder. It's a vicious weapon that has killed countless people since a long time ago."

"Vicious......"

"There's a big difference between wanting to kill and actually killing. But there's no difference for the &lt;Executioner&gt;."

Verdi hurriedly hid the short sword.

"I don't care if it's vicious. This knife saved my mom. No one protected our family!"

Shirone nodded.

"I know you did your best. The &lt;Executioner&gt; really only activates when you're desperate. You wanted to protect your family, right?"

"Huhuh. Huhuhuh."

Verdi sobbed.

"I didn't really want to kill. I just... I just wanted to protect my mom......"

"Yeah. But the &lt;Executioner&gt; isn't as nice as you. So let's stop here. If this happens again, it's not the knife, it's you."

Shirone stroked Verdi.

"You can't protect your family with anger. If you rely on such a vicious thing, you'll really lose what's important."

Verdi cried out in fear.

"Uaaaaang! Mom! Mommy!"

"......"
