The leader of Yongnoi has a duty to give the most clear and reasonable answer to the king's question.

The types of questions range from metaphysical to physical.

It's embarrassing to ask the secrets of the universe, but when asked what the hardest question to answer is, Albino said this.

"What should I eat for lunch today?"

This anecdote tells us how much a king relies on the leader of Yongnoi.

That's why it wasn't strange that the Merkodain family's mansion was located in the royal management area, unlike other nobles.

"Hmm, you mean the leader of Yongnoi lives here?"

Kido, who had heard the word Yongnoi over and over again since he was the leader of Speedkiller.

"It's not a leader, it's a leader. But it's still not restored. How badly did it collapse?"

When Lian looked over the mansion, dozens of laborers were in full swing.

"Here's the royal management area, right? Was there a civil war?"

"Ha ha! No. Iruki blew it up. It's the magic he cast at the end of the graduation exam."

Arganes, Iruki's mother, who received a report from the butler, quickly crossed the garden.

"Welcome, Shiro."

"Hello. You're still beautiful."

Arganes covered her face and twisted her body.

"Oh, it's a little difficult to say that. My husband is on duty now, so he comes home very late."

Shiro smiled and said,

"I don't think that matters much."

"Ho ho! That's right. Iruki also went to work at Yongnoi. He doesn't even think about coming in because he looks like his father."

I could see it without seeing it.

"Can I ask for a Yongnoi pass? I have something to talk to Iruki."

It wasn't a Yongnoi that friends could go to chat, but it was enough business relevance for Shiro, the core of the Radum incident.

"I'll give you an inner city pass. Iruki will probably be waiting. The situation is unstable these days."

Even if you don't want to hear it, secrets come in like gossip if you're the hostess of Merkodain.

"Yes, thank you."

So Shiro's party, who received the inner city pass, crossed the threshold of the inner city, which can be called the core of the royal city.

There were individual Buddha buildings in the beautiful garden, and the people passing by were all nobles.

Shiro found a friend sitting on a garden bench, staring blankly at the sky with a bushy head.

"Iruki!"

When he shouted happily in a not-so-noisy street, Iruki, who had been sipping tea, turned his head.

"Here, here!"

When Shiro couldn't find him, he even waved his hand to let him know his location.

Iruki, who had been watching carefully like a turtle, finally smiled and lifted his teacup.

"Hey, Shiro."

Merkodain Iruki (20 years old).

A flat-level researcher at Yongnoi, a direct advisory agency of the king.

I thought my friends would always be the same, but when I met them in society, I was overwhelmed.

"I've been waiting. You're an hour early. Come in."

Shiro tilted his head, but it was impossible to fully understand the human being Iruki.

As Iruki crossed the corridor as if it were his own house, the soldiers and managers all showed respect.

"You're really Yongnoi. You've been promoted, haven't you?"

"Ha ha."

Iruki, who seemed to have heard a scary joke, just spat out a dry laugh.

Iruki, who brought Shiro's party to the lab and served tea, stared at Kido's face.

"But what about this guy? It's rude to say this at first sight, but haven't you heard that you look like a goblin?"

Kido fired back at the ridiculous joke.

"I'm a goblin! Aren't you my long-lost brother?"

Shiro introduced himself.

"Kido. I'm going to travel together."

"Ah, Kido of Seopsik. The leader of Speedkiller. Radum political hierarchy 179th, power ranking 7th, special ability is the taste of memory."
[Translated block]


"Shirone was surprised by the appearance of Iruki, who was already showing signs of dragon thunder, but Kido didn't seem to like it.

"My power is only 7th? There was no Ainz species that could beat me except Drakkar. Humans also have poor information."

"According to that poor information, you are now number one."

It was known that all the executives of Spectrum, who were ranked higher than Kido, had died.

Kido, who had nothing to say, turned around with a clear dislike for this human, but Shirone was strangely relieved.

"You're still the same. How have you been lately?"

A sigh that seemed to sink the ground was heard.

"Prediction, prediction. Collecting data from Wangseong and writing a prediction report on an hourly, 12-hour, and 24-hour basis is my job. For example, if Madelen comes in now……."

As soon as the words ended, the maid opened the door and came in.

"Mr. Iruki, a meeting of the flat-rank researchers has been convened. It's said to be an urgent matter."

"I got it. I'll go on time."

When Madelen left, Iruki pointed to the closed door.

"Did you see? It's like this. Probably, she has a 64.8 percent chance of getting a stomachache within 72 hours. There was an incident of water pollution in Wangseong yesterday, and low-quality ice is supplied in order of low rank, and fruit shaved ice comes out at dessert time today. And according to my data analysis! She has only missed fruit shaved ice twice in five years!"

When Iruki shouted, slamming the table, an unpleasant silence flowed in the lab.

"……You're having a hard time."

Iruki, sitting on the sofa, covered his face with both hands.

"It's not that easy to say. I checked Madelen's medical records, water source reports, medical books, and personal observation diaries. Ah, why did we train so hard at magic school. Big data and what, I want to sleep to death."

Although it seemed like a useless analysis, all information starts from the combination of small things.

This was also a training that the members of the Dragon Thunder had to go through, and the quality of the information handled naturally increased as the rank increased.

In this way, the top brains are in full operation 24 hours a day, predicting the system of the entire kingdom and analyzing risk factors.

'The one at the top is Iruki's father.'

Judging from Iruki's case, the amount and quality of information handled by Merkodain Albino was unimaginable.

"Hang in there, Iruki."

Iruki, who knew what Shirone wanted to say, stuck out his lips with a chin.

"Well, good days will come if you do it. It's not just me who's having a hard time. At least it's better than Nade."

"Speaking of which, where's Nade?"

"He's working at the alchemy headquarters in the countryside. He seems to have entered the transport team, and the work is very hard."

"But didn't he say he was going to open a store?"

"Well, but it seems a little short if you consider the cost of materials. He said he would save money with Liz and open a small store first."

"If it's about money, rather……."

From a friend's point of view, it was reluctant, but there were plenty of brokers in the world who would pay a fortune to hire Nade's skills.

"You know, his personality. He won't use magic. I even offered to lend it, but if you want to become a merchant, you have to know the bottom line. It's not wrong. I'm doing it now."

"Yeah. Everyone is working hard."

The sight of friends doing their best to live would be the value of humanity that Shirone risked his life to protect.

"How about you? I saw the Radum report in my father's library, but is there a chance to pass the test with this?"

"I don't know about that. So I came to ask you for some advice. And tell you about what I've been through."

Shirone briefly told him what had happened in Radum, adding explanations from Lian and Kido.

"Hmm, so La Enemy disappeared in the end. It's definitely an ambiguous situation."

The condition for passing the test was to find La Enemy and then safely arrive at the Ivory Tower.

"Cheer up, Iruki."

Iruki, who knew what Shirone wanted to say, stuck out his lips with a chin.

"Well, good days will come if you do it. It's not just me who's having a hard time. At least it's better than Nade."

"Speaking of which, where's Nade?"

"He's working at the alchemy headquarters in the countryside. He seems to have entered the transport team, and the work is very hard."

"But didn't he say he was going to open a store?"

"Well, but it seems a little short if you consider the cost of materials. He said he would save money with Liz and open a small store first."

"If it's about money, rather……."

"But it was just a past event that Shirone had met, and now even that place was extinct.

"Okay, I'll solve it. You can ask the party directly."

"Huh? The party?"

Iruki, who seemed determined, got up from his seat and opened the lock of the secret safe under the desk.

"What are you doing? I'm really anxious right now."

"You thought I was just investigating diarrhea? The good thing about coming into Yongnoe is that I can 'steal' the top secret at will. Let's see, if you calculate the route...."

The school was leaking, and it was the same in society.

"I don't know what you're thinking, but is it really okay? That's a violation of the kingdom's security law."

"That's for ordinary people. It's just a secret view between the same departments. If you get caught, you'll be disciplined for privilege. Okay, the calculation is over. Let's go."

When Iruki went out into the hallway with a code, Madeleine, who was smiling with a fruit ice cream, was surprised.

"Oh my! Where are you going? The meeting is soon...."

"I have something to do. Please tell them I'm absent."

"Flat ranks don't have the right to be absent!"

"Just say anything to get me out. Oh, say my mom is giving birth to her second child right now. I'm going instead of my dad."

"Huh?"

Iruki, who was looking back at Madeleine standing with a blank expression, pointed to the fruit ice cream.

"Throw that away and eat mine instead."

When Iruki escaped from the lab, the ministries of various countries on the planet Torumia were facing a major emergency.

"It just came in through the outer star gate!"

The first-class border alert was issued, and the guards were fully armed and guarded the Grand Hall like an iron wall.

King Adolf of the Kingdom of Torumia was sitting on the throne, but unusually, the queen was not visible.

It was because they thought about the case where the face of the kingdom was cut off.

"It has entered the inner star!"

Just by the report of quickly breaking through the gate of one country, anger rose on Adolf's face.

"Your Majesty, shall we operate the magic control device?"

"Stop it. There's no need to provoke it unnecessarily. And anyway...."

He couldn't spit out the words that there was a high probability that it wouldn't work.

"It has arrived at the star!"

At the same time as the report, the voice of a woman shaking the inside began to echo loudly with the amplification of sound magic.

"Don't look at my panties!"

"......Huh?"

The ministers, who were frowning at the roar, all turned to look at the entrance of the Grand Hall.

"Close your eyes! I mean, control your optic nerves!"

A black girl walking down the hallway with a big step was holding up a short skirt with one hand and holding out the emblem of the Ivory Tower, a symbol of the system inspection department, with the other.

Behind her was a giant black man who was wearing sunglasses and had a huge sword on his shoulder.

"Don't look at my panties!"

Not only the maids but also the high-ranking bureaucrats opened the way by stepping back with their heads deeply bowed, and then the girl stopped abruptly.

Then the black man squatted down and stretched one leg long and pointed his finger at the sunglasses.

"You! You just saw my panties!"

"No! I didn't see it! I absolutely...."

"Don't even imagine it! Don't think about anything! Before I tear your brain out!"

The bureaucrat felt like his ears were falling off as the amplified voice shook the hallway.

'Damn it! If you don't show it, it's okay!'

It was a question of what kind of mind it was to raise a skirt and walk while saying not to look.

"Don't do what I tell you not to do! Got it?"

"Yes! I understand!"

The girl turned her body coldly and walked down the hallway, and kicked open the door leading to the Grand Hall.

"King Adolf, be humble! The Ivory Tower System Inspection Department has come to find out the truth about this incident!"

The guards all pulled out their swords at once, but King Adolf slowly raised his hand to stop them.

"I am King Adolf."

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
