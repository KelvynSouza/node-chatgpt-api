[728] Physical (1)

Upon reaching the summit where the moon of Whiteblack was rising, Shirone emphasized to the man who hid Kai's body.

"If you do something foolish, there will be no chance."

"I know. I don't want to die either."

The man named Jurak was a considerable player in the Black area, and he voluntarily participated in the survival test.

"I've had enough fun. I want to end it now."

Shirone was curious about the words that seemed to contain the philosophy of the Black area.

"You can fight as much as you want on your side, right? Why did you participate in the survival test?"

"I was born and wandered at the bottom. Where should I look... was it when I was eight years old? I killed a person for the first time. There was no guilt. He tried to kill me first. Anyway, as time passed and I became stronger..."

Jurak smiled broadly.

"I wanted to see how strong I was. In fact, isn't everyone like that? There is no human being who only looks up. They run like crazy because there is something underneath."

"So... you participated for such a reason? You wanted to know how strong you were?"

"Fighting in Black is everyday. How everyday is it, if you're hungry, just break into any house and kill. And you can eat the food he has. It's not fun, it's not fun. That's just life. It's not a dangerous game or anything. Think about it. Can White handle it when such a demon participates?"

Jurak waved his hand.

"They can never win. We are gamblers who take other people's lives with our lives as chips. The outcome of the law fight depends on whether the gambler participates or not."

"So the odds are similar..."

"Ha ha! Right. White also needs hope to fight their best, right? They deliberately send weak guys and lose a few games, and when they get heated, they take it all at once. And this time it was my turn to enjoy..."

A shadow fell on Jurak's face.

"I was unlucky to be hit on the back of the head. Because of you. How can you send a wizard? There are only a few in Black."

Shirone didn't want to hear more.

"Guide me to Kai."

"Don't worry. I brought a weak guy to raise the difficulty level. He will probably protect it like a lifeline."

Jurak, who descended from the summit of Anarchy Mountain to the east, said as he pushed through the dense willow branches.

"Here, here it is."

There was no Kai's body, let alone a living person, in the landscape proudly introduced.

"What, what is it?"

Jurak quickly turned around and waved his hand at Shirone.

"No, no! I definitely told Rusell to keep it! This is never my intention...!"

"Activate. Suicide Squad."

A card flashed from where the voice was heard.

Suicide Squad (Summon).

Description: The ancient Gilitians chose to die at the end of their lives.

Effect: Summon the soul of an ancient Gilitian by destroying an S-rank card.

Special note: A desperate blow is activated.

"For Giliti!"

Unlike the commonly imagined soul, the Gilitian with tattoos all over his body was as vivid as the real thing.

"Cough!"

The blade penetrated Jurak's back, and soon his clothes began to stain with blood.

"How can you activate the Suicide Squad...?"

It was the only card Rusell had, but it needed an S-rank card to activate.

"Bad boy! Because of you..."

Rusell, whose face was pale as if he was sick, staggered and appeared, and a familiar woman was standing next to him.

"Breeze?"

The person who activated the Suicide Squad was Breeze from the White area.

'How did you know and come here?'

Breeze looked at Shirone with a resigned look and said.

"I'm sorry. I had no choice."

"Breeze! You traitor!"

Three participants from the White area who chased after her came through the bushes, bleeding.

"Atria!"

"Shirone! Be careful of that woman! She ran away after stealing all our cards! Black... huh?"
[Translated block]


Atria, who confirmed the face of the man standing next to Breeze, stopped talking, and Ballard wore a dumbfounded expression.

"Russell? Did you participate too?"

Russell was in a relationship promised with Breeze.

However, Breeze's parents could not accept him, who was congenitally weak in heart, and the marriage was eventually canceled by vote.

Russell, who could not overcome his anger and committed violence, was eventually banished to Black. That was three years ago.

"But did you meet? Behind our backs?"

Even Ballard, who is in charge of the security of the White Zone, did not know that the two were continuing their relationship.

'Come to think of it…….'

Breeze knew the details of the weapon card.

"Russell! How dare you deceive me!"

When Ballard raised his sword and charged, Breeze summoned the magic return disease he received from Shiro.

"Kiaaaa!"

Ten skeletons in old armor rose from the ground and attacked Ballard with a waddling step.

"This, this……!"

Since he had already handed over all the weapon cards, he had no choice but to fight with pure physical ability.

"Breeze! I'll kill you!"

While pouring out curses that blew off the skull of the skeleton, Breeze turned her body holding Russell's hand.

"Quick! This way!"

The moment Breeze heard the sound of flesh tearing open and shrugged her shoulders, she opened her eyes wide.

"Damn woman."

Jurak, whose clothes were already soaked with blood, was standing with a dagger accurately inserted into Breeze's heart.

"Detective."

By the time Russell realized the existence of the special ability latent, Breeze's heart had already stopped beating.

"Breeze!"

Shirone checked the status of Jurak and Breeze, but it was already a cold corpse.

"It looks good, traitor!"

When Ballard, who had annihilated the magic return disease, approached, Russell collected Breeze's card.

"Don't do anything stupid. Even if you have a weapon card, you can kill a weak guy like you in one shot."

Russell was also in a state of losing his reason in front of his lover's death.

"Shut up! You're no different from those who drove me out! What did Breeze do wrong to die here!"

"It's a decision by vote! It's because we drove out violence that peace is maintained in White! And Breeze betrayed us! With you!"

"……Don’t talk nonsense."

Russell pointed at Shirone.

"Breeze participated in the survival test to save me. To get a CPR card!"

Marco shouted.

"Do you think that will work? CPR doesn't cure heart disease."

"Of course. But if you resurrect after death, your body will be as clean as new. It's a fact that everyone knows in Black."

Artis frowned.

"So you tried to save your brother? Anyway, you were banished to Black. One of the two has to die?"

"Black is not a place where a sick person can live. I'm less than trash."

Russell was dying.

"The village chief told me to participate in this survival test and end my life grandly. It was a life that I had abandoned. But Breeze……."

Russell's gaze turned to the dead Breeze.

"Breeze never gave up until the end. He said that if this damn heart beats properly! I was confident that I could make her happy for the rest of my life!"

Regardless of the victory or defeat of White and Black, the two were thinking of curing the disease and crossing Anarchy Mountain.

To a world that is not divided into white and black, but exists somewhere in all gray.

"But now it's all over."

Russell looked at Shirone with a desperate look.

"Kai is already dead. Please use CPR on Breeze. I'm going to die! Just save her!"

Shirone looked down at the card with a bitter expression.

'Whose card is this?'

Then Marco attacked Russell from the side.

"Give me my card! Hurry!"
[Translated block]


There were still two participants in Black, and a weapon card was absolutely necessary.

In the situation where Valard and Atria, who had rushed in, were pressing down on Russel, they were having a mouth fight.

"That's my card! Give it back!"

"Shut up! I have a family! I'll have this, so you guys protect me!"

"I'm the one who fought the most fiercely here! It's all mine!"

Russel, whose arms and legs were pressed down by the participants of White, closed his eyes tightly and shouted.

"Breeze!"

At the same time as the voice of despair colored the night sky, Shiroene threw the CPR card and let it fly in the wind.

'It's human life.'

It's the fierceness of a creature that can never be beautiful even if white and black are harmonized.

'So, law, don't mock.'

Isn't there no choice but to live like that?

"Mom! I'm going back! I... I..."

"Breeze! Breeze!"

Shiroene, who was looking up at the moon of White Black, slowly spread her arms and said.

"Don't mock human life."

The body that opened the immortal function emitted light.

* * *

Jin Seong-eum said.

"It's different from what I heard in the rumors."

It was definitely.

'I thought it would be a little warmer.'

He was a boy with a cold gaze that could be compared to himself.

'More than anything...'

It was anxious to watch him.

Like a condensed flash just before the explosion, it was a pale temperament that seemed to emit something at any moment.

'It's almost reached something.'

It's likely to explode even if you don't touch it, but if you've come this far, it's likely to explode even if you don't touch it.

"I am Jin Seong-eum, the princess and magician of Jincheon Empire, a candidate for the Ivory Tower."

"I know. I've heard the story."

As Seong-eum moved, Moon-kyung's eyebrows twitched and he measured the distance with a serious expression.

'Twenty steps.'

Seong-eum measures the distance to everyone.

"I've heard about you too. I'm jealous, I'm annoyed, and maybe I was a little hopeful...."

'Fifteen steps.'

The speed of approaching Shiroene was still constant.

"But I'm not here because someone understands me. So if I look at you now...."

'Ten steps.'

It was a superhuman realm from now on.

"But I'm not here because someone understands me. So if I look at you now...."

'Five steps.'

Seong-eum's steps stopped here.

"I'm honestly angry."

"......"

Seong-eum, who frowned and grumbled, stepped towards Shiroene again.

'Four steps.'

"What I really expected was...."

'Three steps.'

Moon-kyung's eyes popped out.

"Maybe for the first time in my life, I thought I might meet someone who could walk side by side with me."

'Two steps!'

Moon-kyung was frustrated.

"But it seems that you, who have a great card, can't walk side by side with me."

At the moment when Seong-eum's steps finally stopped, the samurai opened their mouths as if they couldn't believe it.

"Give me a step."

At a distance close enough for the breath to reach, Seong-eum's index finger aimed at Shiroene's forehead.

"I'm one step ahead of you."

In the silence, Moon-kyung shouted in his heart.

'Be proud! Worship the princess! It's a great thing to allow one step!'

He couldn't dare to imagine Shiroene's view, looking at Jin Seong-eum's face right in front of him.

'This is Jin Seong-eum.'

It was just as the residents of the Ivory Tower said.

'What's so important?'

If it was before coming to Andre, he would have been angry at Seong-eum's words, but now he had no feelings.

"Whatever the card is...."

"Huh?"

When Seong-eum made a strange expression, Shiroene smiled and stepped aside.
