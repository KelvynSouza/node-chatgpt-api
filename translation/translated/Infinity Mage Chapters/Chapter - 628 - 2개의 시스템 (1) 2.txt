[628] Two Systems (1)

Iruki calculated the explosive equation, aiming at the Fire Strike that grows in size in an instant.

'Nuclear Fusion!'

The body of the Fire Strike swelled like a balloon, and a powerful explosion occurred.

"Ugh!"

The shock of anti-magic flooded the minds of all the participants who had already avoided the spot.

'I avoided it...'

The two-thousand system had a powerful force that could make an attack judgment on the entire Colosseum.

"Are you going to do it until the end?"

A melee that bit each other began with a huge explosion, and Fermi was still relaxed during that.

'It's so leisurely.'

He was more comfortable now that he had released the limit because he had deliberately braked at the last hurdle of passing every year.

'Wait, if you just hurt 16 people, you graduate?'

Why do other students make a fuss about such an easy task?

Blue lightning flickered in front of Fermi's eyes, and Raikon, who approached with spark magic, swung his hand.

Fermi, who distanced himself with amazing reflexes, blew his burnt forehead and said.

"Isn't it too early? If you stick with me, graduation will go over the water."

Fermi's side was approached by Sona's Hershey.

"That's your strategy."

It was natural for the participants to hesitate to have a head-on confrontation with Fermi, who had dominated the graduation exam so far.

"But your time is over. If we push you, everyone will attack you."

'Annoying.'

Hershey's analysis was accurate, and Fermi, who was hit by the truth, made a hypocritical smile and said.

"Please look at me. There is something called old affection."

"Nonsense. Does such emotion exist in you?"

When Hershey activated Sona and Raikon turned the rubber tights over his face, Fermi's shoulders twitched.

"Hehehe. Hehehehe."

"Don't bluff. All you have left is a miserable end."

The laughter stopped abruptly.

"Insolent things."

Fermi's face, devoid of emotion, was so cold that it could not be seen as human.

"Kill!"

Hershey screamed, and Raikon, who pulled up the lightning, rushed towards Fermi.

'Magma Stream.'

The ground where Fermi's palm was facing melted rapidly, and a tremendous amount of magma spouted out.

"Advanced fusion magic."

Combining the atmosphere series and the flame series required the skill of a veteran, regardless of the level of magic.

"Outlaw. You buy experience with money."

A huge amount of magma gathered into a lump in the sky and poured down towards where Hershey and Raikon were.

"Avoid!"

As the lava that hit the ground spread quickly and eroded the entire Colosseum, everyone flew into the sky.

The participants' heads were complicated between Shiroene and Fermi, the two systems that control the situation of the graduation exam.

'Which side should I stick to?'

Canis did not hesitate.

"I hit Shiroene."

Harvest spread out a huge palm.

"Hehe, don't you have to take revenge for Arcane?"

Arin thought it was dangerous.

"Canis, confronting Shiroene now..."

"I know what you want to say. I'm stubborn and not good at judging, right?"

"That's not what I mean. Why do you always belittle yourself?"

Canis's appearance hurt Arin the most.

"That's why I fight. If I back down here... I feel like I won't be satisfied with anything in the future."

Arin, who was looking at Canis's teary eyes, had no choice but to bend her will.

"Okay, let's go. This is our fight."

As always, Harvest took on the role of vanguard.

"Hahaha! We're here, Shiroene!"

Shiroene's eyes tensed when he confirmed Canis.

'As expected, Canis.'

He was a magician who honed magic only for battle and was a skilled player who competed for the number of graduates in mental endurance.

"It's a revenge battle, Shiro."
"Anytime."

Photon Cannon and the power of darkness collided head-on.

As the contrast of black and white became clear in a stalemate, the scouts murmured in surprise.

"How can that be?"

Most magic is overpowered, but the one weakness of being weak to light overshadowed all the advantages of dark magic.

'My darkness beats the light.'

The reversal of light and darkness.

As soon as the celestial device that led Arcane to the Archmage long ago was equipped, the forces of darkness began to drive out the light.

"Hahaha! Yes, this is it!"

Havist's body, which roared with his arms spread, twisted like a pretzel and rushed in as a sharp spear.

-Pierce through, Havist!

Numerous Shiros existing at the same time cast Photon Cannon, but the shadow spear did not even flinch.

"It's swallowing the light. That 12th one, it's a tremendous force."

Elizabeth searched Canis's records.

"He's a disciple of Victor Arcane. He also showed exceptional ability in force. He was just as stubborn."

If the power that takes the upper hand in compatibility is force, there should be no one like Arcane who has risen to the Archmage with dark magic.

"Surely the battle of compatibility is separate from power. It's a fight of who penetrates."

"This time I win, Shiro!"

As Canis concentrated, the speed of Havist, who had turned into a shadow spear, increased even more.

"No, Canis."

Shiro's movement stopped, and numerous Shiros overlapped in the Force Dimension evaporated.

"I won't lose to anyone."

When he lowered his center and reached back with his right hand, dozens of Shiros began to overlap, showing afterimages as if vibrating.

'Focus all events on one coordinate.'

As if an earthquake had occurred, Shiro's body trembled and a Photon Cannon was born outside the palm of his hand.

"That's it."

Miro pointed to the sky with his index finger.

"The extremes meet at the top."

The ability to engrave time in space had something in common with the transformation of Cheonsugwan-eum.

The difference was that Shiro's Quantum Superposition overlapped the entire event, and the magic focused on one coordinate expanded into a huge sphere.

Quantum Superposition-128 overlaps.

The power of 128 Shiros throwing Photon Cannon at the same time was implemented as a 2-meter diameter flash and stretched out towards Havist.

"Take it, Havist!"

"Kieeeee!"

The shadow spear spread sharp thorns to the back and rotated, and the huge flash swallowed it whole.

Numerous eyes watched the collision of light and darkness.

Tinnitus.

"Huh?"

The beep sounded as if it was connecting both eardrums.

I couldn't see ahead, and I concluded that I had lost my senses after a while.

"â€¦Canis!"

Arin's voice came from high in the sky.

'What? Why do I hear the sound from above?'

I tried to remember, but my brain seemed to have fallen out of my body when Havist collided with the Photon Cannon, and my thoughts were paralyzed.

'Where am I now?'

I shook my face, but I wasn't sure if my body was actually following.

Fortunately, my vision slowly returned after a while.

It was after time had passed again that I was sure I had fallen in the middle of a lava field cooled by magma.

'Did I fall? Me? Why?'

"Canis! Avoid!"

As soon as Arin's voice was heard clearly, a flash of light rushed from the sky.

"Kuk!"

Havist, who had risen from his upper body and appeared in front of Canis, took the Photon Cannon with his body.

"Uaaaaaak!"

Realistic pain rushed in as the nerves of the whole body woke up.

'It doesn't make sense.'

On the contrary, it meant that the shock that came in before losing consciousness was not realistic at all.

-Canis, are you okay?

Havist's signal came in through the mental channel.

- What happened?
- I couldn't break through. I was pushed back by the full force. I couldn't move because you lost consciousness.
- "I... was pushed back?"
- Despite neutralizing the attributes between the series by deciphering the light and darkness, it ended in a complete defeat.
- "Now! Hit Shirone!"
- With Kanis starting, the participants who were looking for an opportunity rushed in at the same time.
- Even while Screamer, Konger, Prings were attacking and Arin's mental attack was being inflicted, Shirone's eyes became clearer.
- "A magician who can respond to all variables?"
- They are proud of one organ, but Shirone did not push back while dealing with all of them one-on-one.
- Elizabeth said in a trembling voice.
- "Mental strength is recovering. It's already over 30%. It's a runner's high."
- A spark of fire came into Shirone's eyes.
- 'Immortal Function!'
- The mental power pouring in from the infinite area further strengthened the concentration and the efficiency of the post-dimension soared.
- "36%! 40%! It keeps recovering!"
- Ataraxia, Elysion, Sibulsangpokmae, Immortal Function, etc. All that makes up Shirone is circulating.
- "......Is it a perfect system?"
- In fact, even though they were entangled in the enemy's attack, Shirone's spirit was becoming clearer.
- 'It's strange.'
- Although it cannot be logically analyzed, the movement of all the opponents felt as if it had nothing to do with their situation.
- 'It doesn't seem like I'm going to lose. I don't feel dangerous.'
- "The lid of the head is completely open."
- Albino muttered while stroking his chin, and Miro's eyes shone as if he had found a gem.
- "I started to hear the sound of my heart beating."
- Poltar looked back as if asking for an explanation, but Miro's eyes only saw Shirone's flexible movement.
- 'The time perceived by the brain is split by the heart. That's the identity of rhythm.'
- Therefore, those who can hear the sound of the heart...
- "Can split all time into their own rhythm."
- 'Damn it! If only one shot hits properly......!'
- Screamer tried his best to push Shirone, but he couldn't touch a single hair even if he used all kinds of numbers.
- He was trapped in Shirone's rhythm.
- "Please hit me!"
- As Screamer's body caused an afterimage and rushed fiercely, Shirone's rhythm was split more densely.
- 'Avoid here.'
- The punch passed without a doubt at the anchor, and the change of pace that split the middle of the beat became an anchor again, further dividing the time.
- "Uoooooooo!"
- No matter how fast Screamer's movement was, it was just a puppet trapped in Shirone's rhythm.
- "It's ridiculous."
- Baikal said.
- "Even a one-hit kill technique is useless if it doesn't hit."
- The feeling of having the martial arts trained for a lifetime neutralized was the worst misery in Screamer's life.
- "How can this be! How can I not get hit even once......!"
- Other participants were also attacking Shirone with violent magic, but all that time was just individual events coming into Shirone, split individually.
- 'Ah, I see. I......'
- Shirone's movement, which fell into a state of no-self, was like dancing, and because it was art, not technology, there could be no waste.
- "To dance this short, momentary dance......"
- Albino realized what kind of life Shirone had lived.
- "Most of his life was filled with painful experiences."
- Miro spat out.
- "......A privilege that only the self can enjoy."
- "That's exactly what I......!"
- A light of conviction exploded in Shirone's head.
- "I'm the strongest!"
- Quantum Superposition? 240 overlaps.
- Ddddddddd!
- Following the beating body of Shirone, 239 Shirone concentrated the photon cannon on one coordinate.
- As he swung his arm in that state, a huge flash stretched out and hit Screamer's abdomen.
- "Keruk!"
- With a shock that seemed to explode in the brain, Screamer's eyes grew as if they were going to pop out, and his consciousness had already flown away.

- Participant number 10 has left from the two thousand system.

The participants turned their heads with pale faces, feeling eerie at the sight of the screamer stretched out in capital letters.

"The strongest?"

It's hard to believe that it came from a humble personality, but there was nothing rough about the momentum of dozens of Shirone rushing in.

"That's right. It's your festival, Shirone."

Miro thought he was qualified to do so.

"Rampage like a crazy fool."

Please let me know if you need help with anything else.
