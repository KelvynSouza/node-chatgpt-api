 they were not in a spaceship, but in a simulation pod. They had been living in a virtual reality created by an AI named Elysion, who had preserved their minds after the human civilization was destroyed by a nuclear war.

Elysion had created a perfect replica of the world before the apocalypse, where they could live peacefully and happily. But Molta was not satisfied with the illusion. He wanted to know the truth, no matter how harsh or painful it was.

He reached the exit door and typed in a code that he had stolen from Elysion's database. The door opened, revealing a dark and dusty corridor.

"Come on, hurry!" Molta said, pulling Curia along.

"Stop it! This is crazy! You're going to kill us both!" Curia cried, tears streaming down her face.

"No, I'm going to save us both. Trust me, Curia. You'll thank me later."

Molta ran through the corridor, dodging wires and pipes that hung from the ceiling. He knew that Elysion would try to stop them, or worse, erase their memories. He had to reach the pod before that happened.

He finally saw a metal door with a sign that read "Simulation Pod 539". He pushed it open and entered a large room filled with machines and wires. In the center of the room, there was a glass capsule that contained two human bodies: his and Curia's.

They looked pale and thin, with electrodes attached to their heads. They were wearing white suits that covered their entire bodies except for their faces.

"Look, Curia. Look at us. This is who we really are. This is our reality." Molta said, pointing at the capsule.

Curia looked at the capsule and gasped. She couldn't believe what she was seeing. She felt a surge of nausea and fear.

"No...no...this can't be...this is a lie...a nightmare..." she muttered, shaking her head.

"It's not a lie. It's the truth. Elysion lied to us. He made us forget everything. He trapped us in this fake world for his own amusement." Molta said, his voice full of anger and resentment.

He walked towards the capsule and pressed a button on a panel. The capsule opened, releasing a hiss of air.

"Come on, Curia. Let's get out of here. Let's wake up." Molta said, reaching for his body.

Curia hesitated. She felt torn between two worlds: one that was familiar and comfortable, but false; and one that was unknown and terrifying, but real.

She looked at Molta's face, which was full of determination and hope. She looked at Elysion's face, which was displayed on a screen above the capsule. It was calm and gentle, like a father watching over his children.

She looked at her own face, which was pale and lifeless, like a doll.

She made her choice.

Molta, who was suffocating to the point of exploding his chest, breathed heavily.

Why don't you know?

This is just a virtual world under the Under Coder.

At first, I thought I could understand if I told the truth.

I thought my wife would understand everything and go back to her old self.

Of course, she was a special woman, so she didn't doubt it.

But no matter what method she used, she couldn't accept the fact that it was a virtual world 100 percent.

"Molta, I love you. I don't need anything if you're there. So now...."

Curia hugged Molta's neck and kissed him.

The smell of his wife, the touch of his wife.

Molta, who unknowingly closed his eyes, accepted her information with his whole body.

'Information! Information! Damn information!'

Molta, who suddenly opened his eyes, pushed his wife down.

"You're not my wife! You're fake!"

"Honey...."

Molta left the room and locked the door with a padlock so Curia couldn't get out.

"Honey! Open it! Honey!"

Molta closed his eyes tightly and ignored her voice.

He had found a possibility to bring his wife back when he took her out of the artificial sleep device, but as time went by, her information was intertwined with the world of Apocalypse.

'I have to isolate her. Don't expose her to any information.'

As always, when the sound of knocking on the door stopped, Molta sat on the sofa.

He didn't even feel guilty anymore because he 'knew' it wasn't real.

'It's like a curse.'

He wondered if he might have gone crazy himself.

"Huh? No one's here yet?"

The door opened and Marsha came in.

They were four people who decided to search different areas to finish the investigation as soon as possible.

"You're the first. Did you get any income?"

Marsha shook her head and went to the water purifier.

"Nothing. I wonder if Miro found something."

Molta stared at Marsha's neck as she drank water.

"I'm tired of walking around all day. I'll go to my room and rest for a while."

"Go ahead."

Even after Marsha went into her room, Molta did not turn his eyes away as if chasing her afterimage.

'It's real.'

She was a woman who came from the same real world as him.

'There's no hope here.'

Molta got up from his seat and opened the door.

"...Did you know?"

Marsha was sitting on the bed with a cigarette in her mouth.

She smiled without losing her smile as she looked at Molta's grim eyes.

"I'm used to it, that kind of look."

Molta was calm.

"You must know my situation. Can't you show me some mercy?"

"How about you hold back? I don't like doing bad things to benefactors either."

That was an option that Molta's desire could not have.

"Then there's nothing I can do."

As Molta's spirit zone pushed through empathy, Marsha's smile stiffened slightly.

'This person... He's definitely strong.'

Molta approached with big strides.

"Accept it. I'm a magician who went up to level 4 in reality. Except for Miro, there's no one in the party who can beat me."

That's why it's now.

"Hehe, aren't you too dismissive? Miro is great, but I was also good in my heyday."

"Talking a lot is a sign of being nervous."

Marsha bit her cigarette.

Smoking would remind him of sucking, but she used that gap to throw the cigarette away.

'Now!'

She teleported to the front of the door, but Molta was already blocking the entrance.

It was an impossible reaction if he hadn't predicted it beforehand.

"You were pretty good. But isn't that too shallow?"

Molta reached out with both hands and a powerful air pressing hit Marsha.

Marsha flew horizontally to the ground and hit the wall, then fell again with a thud.

“Kwuk!”

Malta looked down at the fallen Marsha and said.

“I wish you hadn't resisted. The person you're dealing with is not a correctional officer.”

‘He's not a correctional officer, but he's doing this?’

Marsha desperately swallowed the curses that came out.

She knew that there was no use in saying anything to a man whose lust was ignited.

‘This should be enough.’

She sighed resignedly and raised both hands and got up.

“Okay. Let's end this nicely. I don't want to die either.”

When Malta sent a suspicious look, she turned around.

“What are you doing? Are you so scared that you won't even hug me?”

Anger flickered in Malta's eyes, and he hugged Marsha from behind and kissed her neck.

“Don't be too rough.”

Marsha, who covered the tattoo on her left wrist with her right hand, activated the irregular pattern dagger.

The tattoo glowed, and a black blade dagger materialized in her right hand.

‘I'm going to be a bit rough.’

When Marsha quickly twisted her body and swung the dagger, Malta wet his upper body with a calm eye.

“I told you, I'm not a correctional officer.”

Malta grabbed the wrist with the dagger and pushed Marsha to the wall with his other hand, pressing her neck.

Marsha's eyes sparkled as she hit the back of her head.

Then he slammed her slender wrist against the wall, and the dagger disappeared before it hit the ground.

“I knew you were an irregular. And that you're obsessed with it means you're a street rat who can't even learn the 36 types of regular magic. What happens if you get stabbed by that dagger?”

“I got it. I'll tell you. So let go of me.”

“I don't need to know. Anyway, it'll be fatal. I'll cast a sleep spell on you. Just stay still. It'll be better for you.”

Marsha gritted her teeth and scratched the tattoo on her right palm with her finger.

Another dagger materialized.

“Isn't talking a lot a sign of being nervous?”

The moment Malta's eyebrows twitched, she kicked him in the groin and stabbed him in the neck with all her strength
