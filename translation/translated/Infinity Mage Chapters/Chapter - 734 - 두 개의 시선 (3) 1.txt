[734] Two Perspectives (3)

"Wow!"

Kido exclaimed in admiration.

There was no one, including Imer who had lost half of his body, who wouldn't call this strike a work of art.

"That, that......"

Unlike Sung-eum, a magician, Moon-gyeong, who pursued the ultimate in physicality, knew exactly what was contained in Lian's fist.

'He captured everything.'

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

'So what's the shortest distance between two moving points?'

That too is a straight line.

'Therefore, an already completed straight line contains all infinite curves.'

Just a moment ago, Lian's fist did that, and it was a strike that no one but Lian could imitate.

'It's not that he didn't avoid it. He couldn't avoid it.'

Moon-gyeong learned a technique called Choshik in his swordsmanship.

However, after seeing Lian's attack just now, he felt a sense of self-abasement, wondering what the use of a thousand curves was.

"Phewwwww!"

Imer, who had disappeared in a circle from his right shoulder to his chest and side, slumped against the wall.

"Are you in pain?"

Rather, Imer asked about Lian's well-being.

"Krrrrrr!"

In the state of Yacha, his muscles twisted and bulged, and the twisted muscle fibers were returning to their original state.

"Pain, you see."

Listening to Lian's groan, Imer lifted his head.

"It's the extreme of sensation. If death is a state where you can't feel anything, pain is life itself."

"Hrrrrrr!"

Looking at Lian, who was writhing in pain while holding his shoulder, Imer lifted the corners of his mouth.

"Cherish it. Because it's proof that you're alive."

When the pain disappears, life also disappears.

"Wait......"

Lian gritted his teeth and lifted his head.

"I haven't heard yet. Why Ogent......"

Does Imer know something?

"You'll find out soon. At the peak of pain."

We'll meet again.

Imer's eyes closed and his body's cells began to shrink as if they were eating themselves.

After the process of extinction was over, only one molar was left in its place.

"Wait! Krrrr!"

When Lian, who had returned to human form, crouched down in tremendous pain, Kido made a fuss.

"What, what do we do! We have to get out of here right now!"

"It's okay. More importantly, Shiro......"

Imer had disappeared, but Shiro's condition was even worse than before.

'It's not an explosion.'

Sung-eum was scared.

'Is she going to die?'

He thought that Shiro might burn everything white and disappear.

"It's blocked."

In her fading consciousness, Shiro muttered.

"Something... is blocked."

If she couldn't break through, she would die, but that was something Shiro had to do somewhere among the 19,000.

"Shiro! I'm going to treat Lian for now!"

It was the right decision since the Maga Thieves and the Maiden had died and even Imer had disappeared.

Kido picked up Lian, but because of the height difference, he looked like he was lying underneath.

Sung-eum stepped forward.

"Wait. I will......"

Suddenly, his words were cut off, and Kido, who was turning his body, quickly stopped and looked ahead.

"What, what is that?"

A ominous flame that seemed impossible for any painter to express was flickering in the shape of a sphere.

"It's too late, Shiro."

The one who revealed himself in that flame was a young man with tattoos all over his body.

"Really...... it's too late."

The moment Nane's eyes met, Lian and Kido disappeared from sight at the same time.

If he was a criminal, he wouldn't be able to catch up, but Nane's eyes were still indifferent.

'I can't win. I can never win.'

Kido, who had arrived at the wall of the labyrinth in one leap, couldn't calm his throbbing heart.

'It's not because I'm weak. No one in this world can handle that human.'

It was such a confident look.

"Princess, that tattoo is......"

"Yes, I know."

Among the Ivory Tower candidates, Sung-eum, who has the most information, blocked Shiro-ne's path.

"Dahlia, no, Psychedelic Nane. That's what they call you, right?"

"What does it matter what my name is?"

Everything in this world has been converging on Nane since she swallowed the dream of Anke Ra.

'Something is different.'

It was a situation where the three Ivory Tower candidates were gathered in one place, and all three were different from the start.

Nane faced Shiro-ne, who was being blocked by Sung-eum.

"I can't delay when I think of the suffering beings, but I came to keep my promise, Shiro-ne."

Shiro-ne desperately held onto her fading consciousness and stood up.

"Promise? What promise?"

"I will be where you are looking for."

At the words of Ra Enemy, Shiro-ne's eyebrows narrowed.

"How did you know that......?"

"Don't you still understand?"

Nane drew a circle with her index and thumb.

"I am the whole."

It was not connected to the sword fire, but it was a feeling that the truth was stuck in the brain with just words.

"Anke Ra......"

Even though the shape and feeling were different, if it was the whole, there was no need to distinguish Nane and Anke Ra especially.

Sung-eum stepped forward.

"I don't know what you're talking about, but if you're our competitor, shouldn't we compete?"

Nane's depth was already understood by Sung-eum, but it was easier than Shiro-ne in terms of penetration.

"Stop it. You can't handle it."

It was not a remark that ignored Sung-eum.

"You're going to die."

"......I don't care."

Although the time she met Shiro-ne was short, if she had to choose an enemy, she would have chosen Nane.

"You're a good person. Please go to the Ivory Tower instead of me and spread your dream."

Mun-kyung's face turned pale.

"Princess!"

"Mun-kyung."

Sung-eum smiled at him for the first time.

"You can bury my body."

"Uaaaaaaaa!"

Mun-kyung, who screamed, drew his sword and charged at Nane.

'It's not because I can't reach you, Princess!'

Even while swinging the best blow of her life, Nane was just watching the lightning strike.

'Because I couldn't dare to reach you!'

Mun-kyung's sword approached Nane's forehead by 1 centimeter in an instant.

'I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll definitely kill you!'

The gap narrowed further, 0.5 centimeters, 0.1 centimeters, and even 0.0000001 centimeters.

'Bend.'

And at that point, Nane declared.

Sermon - Cutting Sword.

As if it was born by breaking through time, a gray sword was born and cut the space before Mun-kyung's sword reached.

'Died......!'

Mun-kyung's view was dyed with a brilliant light, and he hit the ground 20 meters away from Nane.

'How?'

When she came to her senses, Sung-eum was already flying towards Nane.

"Don't insult my subordinate."

There was no such emotion as insult to Nane, who realized the ball, but Sung-eum's ability was interesting.

"It's a wonderful realization."

"Hmph! Don't think you're high up."

Ether Wave - Danagok.

The space around her and Nane distorted, and the direction was perfectly twisted.

'Now, try anything.'

Any attack would have gone to Nane.

"Space."

Nane stretched out both arms and made two different hand signs, and a black sword that sucked everything appeared.

"Gravity."

The space twisted by Danagok was all sucked into the sword.

"Wave."

The formless sword soared high above the head, causing a strong vibration and disrupting the ether wave.

"And......"

When Nane clasped her hands with a generous expression, thousands of brilliantly colored swords spread out in a halo.

"Everything."

Sermon - Paradise Rebirth.

Numerous swords of elements existing in the world spread out in a circle and were all shot at Sung-eum.

At the threshold of death, the question that naturally came to mind was.

'Is it God?'

The sword of light was the first to pierce, followed by swords containing various concepts.

'Huh?'

What she saw in her lifeless state was the figure of Shirone.

"I'm dead?"

"You're not dead."

The place where the two were staying for a moment was the boundary between life and death, Choeni Bardo.

"Is it a park?"

Even though Gukrakwangsaeng failed, there was no ripple in Nane's heart.

"Destroy death."

As the sermon was activated with sword fire, the dark sword pierced the curtain of the world and aimed at Shirone and Sung-eum.

'This was it.'

Looking at the rushing sword, Shirone realized what she had been blocking the sense of explosion.

'It was me.'

Immortal function.

As the mind expanded into infinite territory, Valhalla Action reversed the cause and effect once again.

"Is it a blast this time?"

Nane changed the number.

"There is no beginning or end."

The sword with a pale glow floated like a loach, chasing Shirone's result beyond time.

'Is it God?'

Shirone had no choice but to think the same.

Goblin transformation technique - Jibakryeong.

"Uaaaaaaa!"

When Kido rolled in front of Shirone and activated Jibakryeong, time was slightly twisted as the sword penetrated the wall of the cave.

Kwaah!

Everyone was losing their minds at the sight of the thick mud wall being completely penetrated, but Nane stopped attacking.

"I don't understand."

Just hearing the voice made everyone flinch, and then Lian, who was supported by Moonkyung, joined.

"What are you obsessed with?"

Even if it's put out in the world, it's a place where 5 people can compete for the top, but they all stepped back at Nane's one step.

'It's not strong or that level. This is…….'

I couldn't think of a word to describe it.

"Why do you struggle to live in a world that just ends when you close your eyes?"

Shirone bravely faced it.

"There's no reason. Because I'm alive. That alone is enough to qualify to live."

To Nane, who realized everything, Shirone's words were predicting one of two things.

Shirone was wrong, or he didn't understand.

"The reason I promised to come to you is also to keep you promise."

"What promise?"

Nane's car value is still rising towards perfection, but it was just an endless journey of 99.99999... percent.

"You have a duty to answer the remaining questions."

Nane pointed at Shirone.

"Why can't I become a god?"

There was a moment of silence in the labyrinth.

"God……."

It was the word Kido hated the most, but honestly, if it was Nane, there was no way not to admit it.

"Shirone, I'm almost right."

A sword emitting a red light floated vertically above Nane.

"That's why I'm trying to save this world by carrying an irreversible karma. But because it's almost right, it will be your last chance. If there is no way to deny me, I will end this dream with it."

Perhaps it was a sword with such a concept.

"Shirone, step back. I'll smash a cult leader like him."

Lian raised his sword with a painful body, but Shirone shook his head and took another step forward.

"I don't know if it's the right answer."

This was the third time Shirone had heard this question, including what he didn't remember.

And for the first time, I thought I could answer something.

"But you can never stab that sword."

Nane nodded.

"I know that much. But there's something really important missing. Answer. Why can't you stab?"

Shirone, who had been lost in thought for a moment, slowly turned his head and took in the sight of his party.

Lian, Kido, Sung-eum and Moonkyung.

"However, there is no reason to struggle to live in a world that just ends when you close your eyes?"

Shirone bravely faced it.

"There's no reason. Because I'm alive. That alone is enough to qualify to live."

[Translated block]
"And the countless lives that exist in this world......”

"No! Shirone!"

The moment Lian realizes something and screams, Shirone spread her arms towards Nane.

"This is my answer."

Immortal Function.

It's not for magic.

When she opened her mind with a heart that embraces all life, Shirone's body emitted light in the shape of a cross.

"What, what is it?"

At the same time, the entrances to the world sealed in Andre shook and light bloomed like a lotus flower.

"That is......"

19,000 crosses were rising.
