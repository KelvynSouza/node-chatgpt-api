[763] Lord of Destruction (2)

* * *

"Legion Commander."

The 7th Division Commander, Bessum, who is affiliated with the 24th Legion, approached, clanking in his black iron armor.

"The soldiers are attacking our allies."

The beautiful man, Marduk of Destruction, merely smiled faintly as he sat on his throne.

"Can you stop it?"

Bessum immediately bowed.

"Just leave it to me!"

"Hmm."

When Marduk rose from his seat, the three division commanders who were guarding the place showed their respect.

"Interesting ability. Infection...."

The sight Marduk looked down at from the window was a huge wave that could not distinguish individuality.

"Ugh! Die! Just die!"

Number of infected: 165,843.

Marduk, watching the scene of the demons infected with the walking dead slaughtering their own kind, bared his fangs and laughed.

"Isn't it really a devil?"

The four division commanders silently watched the spectacle outside the window, savoring the irony.

Number of infected: 325,574.

The infection route created on a scale of millions was causing a huge ripple and was rushing towards the leader's palace.

"Get rid of it."

Marduk made a firm decision.

"They are useless."

It was already an irreversible situation, and if the number of infected exceeded one million, even the division commander would be tired.

"I will follow the order."

Shirone and Minerva, who were walking in the middle of the battlefield, took in the distant leader's palace.

"Kill yourself! Commit suicide as soon as you retreat!"

The legion commanders of hell laid down their threats, but it was no longer a situation where the command system could be eaten.

Some demons took their own lives, but statistics always converge on the average, and when the demons who missed the opportunity attacked again, the infection grew like a snowball.

Number of infected: 653,329.

Shirone swallowed his saliva as he walked along the path opened by the army of hell.

'It's over. It's a terrifying magic.'

He had seen the benefits of high population density, but even if it was dispersed, extinction would have been a matter of time.

So it hurt.

'Magic of fratricide.'

When Minerva first revealed this magic to the world, humanity faced extinction.

'Originally to get rid of humans.'

How much terrible human hatred must be embedded for such magic to be implemented in the world?

"Don't be so."

Minerva, puffing out cigarette smoke, tore her mouth and said.

"I'm shy if you compliment me like that."

"......"

When Shirone was lost in thought, there was an explosion in the leader's palace.

"It seems that they finally realized that their buttocks were on fire."

There were four people emitting a clear purple energy visible to the eye in the place pointed by Minerva's pipe.

"It's a division commander."

As soon as the words ended, the demon in black iron armor took a step forward and swung his sword.

"Pitiful things."

The trajectory of the sword, which should end with an afterimage, still remained in space and wriggled, then spread out causing a huge ripple.

"Ugh!"

The number of demons cut by one sword exceeded 300, and the other division commanders also began to eliminate their allies.

"It's a counter-fire operation."

If you remove the target of infection in advance, at least you can prevent the demons from rushing into the leader's palace.

"Judgment like a demon. But I can't stop it anyway."

The number of infected people had already exceeded the number of non-infected people.

"You can buy time. Look there."

When he pointed to the top of the leader's palace, the 24th Legion Commander Marduk was looking down at them with an unpleasant face.

"He's handsome."

Minerva's voice was as cold as an icehouse.

"He must be strong."

The demonic energy was burning like a flame, enough to leave no room for rebuttal.

"I'll take care of the legion commander. You clean up here."

Shirone nodded his head.

"No. This is my job. I'll hurt the legion commander. Please take care of the division commander."
[Translated block]
Minerva let out a hollow laugh.

"Have you ever fought with a legion commander?"

There was none.

"You must know how strong a division commander is. But a legion commander is not at that level. It's the best masterpiece that can be created by the condensation of magic."

The memory of Igor, the Lord of Fear from Radum, tormenting the mercenary group with the 'Brain of the Belly' came to mind.

"The army of hell, born from the raw material of magic infused with Satan's personality. Especially from the division commander level and above, the grotesqueness of personality goes beyond common sense. It's a different issue from Nane's righteousness."

Satan was an existence that was out of the law.

"The reason why Nane's preaching is powerful is ultimately because it is right. His tongue becomes the sword of truth and pierces the world. On the other hand, the reason why your Yahweh is powerful is because it makes the wrong not wrong."

All the laws love Shironne.

"That's the magician of infinity. All things that can be imagined are realized through the light of Yahweh. Then is he a god?"

He is not a god.

"He only exercises the power of God, you are a human. God doesn't imagine anything. Because what he made is everything."

If he had really been a god, Jace would not have accepted the world as suffering.

"Although I'm blabbering arrogantly, you are strong. Surely the only thing that can stop Nane's huge righteousness is your infinity. But that's also a confrontation of expansiveness. If we look at the depth alone..."

It was a firm voice.

"I don't think your realm is deeper than Miro or Veron. At least not yet."

That was also true.

"You are now twenty years old. The reason why you were chosen according to your judgment is because you saw the possibility, not because you believe that you can save the whole right now. Isn't Jace's case the same?"

Minerva moved her steps among all the demons who were infected except for a few commanders.

"Leave it to me. I'll take care of the back."

Shironne touched Minerva's shoulder.

"Please let me do it."

"...This is not a bet. If you die, humanity is over. I don't care about it."

"I won't die. Because there's nothing that can be saved by death."

Minerva turned her body with a click of her tongue.

"Do as you please. Anyway, the world you saved, whether you boil it to death or poison it..."

"Don't worry. I survived against the archangel in heaven."

Minerva gave a bitter smile.

"Angels who can't system destruct..."

"System destruct?"

"It's the owner of the system called Anke Ra. There's no owner who allows you to set fire to your own house."

"I don't understand."

"Listen to the details from Taesung. Why Anke Ra had to seal Imir..."

Minerva, who swung the jet, took a posture to jump out.

"If you're going to do it, I won't stop you, but it's better to be careful. The legion commander withstands Yahweh."

As Minerva rushed fiercely with the jet, Shironne also flew for the time being without folding the question.

'If you hurt the legion commander, the war is over.'

When he fluttered his wings, he arrived at the leader's palace where Marduk was in an instant.

There was a loud noise from where Minerva was, but without a chance to look back, Marduk flew up.

"Is it Yahweh?"

The sword of the legion commander stood vertically, and black energy covered the blade along the handle.

'It's dangerous.'

When Marduk swung his sword, a line stretched to the horizon, dividing the landscape.

"What is that?"

Shironne, who had escaped from the spot using the explosion sense, climbed the opposite spire and observed the ground.

There was no sound, no shock.

The line that stretched straight like a drawn line was a deep gorge that could not guess the depth.

'How deep is it?'

1 kilometer, 10 kilometers, maybe more.

"If you're surprised already, it's going to be tough."

Shironne slowly turned his head, and Marduk was floating a black sphere on his right hand.

"Magic of destruction."

The sphere, which was squishy like oil, fell and pierced the ceiling of the leader's palace.
[Translated block]


"......"

As soon as the interior of the palace was confirmed as a spirit zone, a sphere that penetrated the floors in succession went into the ground.

'It keeps falling.'

It was a phenomenon that could not happen physically.

"Don't worry. It can't penetrate the star."

Shirone looked back at Marduk.

"Just... it's going to hurt a little."

Because it was out of the law, it was different from Nane, and even the wizard of infinity had to squeeze out imagination.

'How do I stop this?'

* * *

Taesung crouched with a painful expression.

"Huh!"

The horrifying shock applied to the star was being transmitted to her body.

"Are you okay?"

Another one of the five invited to the Earth Temple, Saint Mahoro Amanta, approached.

The highest star in balance, he was a thin man with a bald head, brown skin, and many wrinkles around his eyes.

As the wheel held between the thumb and index finger made a winding sound and spun quickly, Taesung's gaze turned there.

'World Wheel.'

Mahoro's meaning was 'the one who turns the world wheel', and the winding sound meant that he would come out if necessary.

Taesung tried to smile.

"Don't worry. I won't be destroyed by this."

Taesung, who had bravely won when a small asteroid collided a long time ago.

"That's right. Even if the devil tries to destroy it, overclocking is a rare thing. It just means that Taesung doesn't have to suffer unnecessary pain."

Amanta pursued only moderation, and in that respect, the current march of the devil had a sense of crossing the road.

"You talk like a teraphos."

"......It's the same philosophy. If you don't keep the rules, you can't exist. I'm not on the side of the devil or humans."

Taesung's sad face was captured between the quickly spinning world wheel wheels.

"I just hope I don't make you sadder."

When Amanta grabbed the world wheel with his hand, he realized how quiet the Earth Temple could be.

"Take care."

Leaving those words behind, when Amanta disappeared, Taesung looked back at the scenery of North Emond reflected on the ceiling.

"Shirone......"

Judgment Day was approaching.

* * *

'Angel's Punishment!'

Hundreds of light archangels threw light spears at the same time, devastating the ground.

The leader's palace had already lost its shape, and the capital full of dictator's greed reminded of a wasteland.

'I can't catch it.'

Every time Marduk's sword drew an afterimage, many Shirone's necks fell off.

They were all Shirone, but they were sacrificed with the intention of protecting the main body.

The problem was that Marduk's sword was spraying the energy of destruction like ink, and any material would disappear just by touching it.

'Homing Photon Cannon!'

As many as two hundred homing photon cannons drew a parabola and attacked Marduk, but he had no reason to move.

"Curtain of Destruction."

The black liquid covered Marduk, and the photon cannon disappeared without a sound, causing a wave of light.

"I misjudged."

Marduk took a big swing with his sword on his side.

"It wasn't even a bait."

When the swordsmanship of great destruction unfolded, the black liquid was sprayed in all directions, drawing a large line.

'Sublimation Explosion!'

Shirone, who penetrated the trajectory of the line using the explosive sense, entered the other world through the Enoch Bard.

'This was it!'

If it was a phenomenon that ignored physics, it had to be an ability that was activated in the realm of Park Ji.

As expected, the black liquid was flying while eroding even the other world, but the shape was different from the real world.

"What the hell is this?"

Thanks to the material shield that bought time, it could be felt as a spirit zone.

Very small creatures were eating iron.

'It's nano.'

Because the number was so large, the decomposition of iron was instantaneous, and Shirone quickly flew his body.

"Do you think it will change if you know?"
