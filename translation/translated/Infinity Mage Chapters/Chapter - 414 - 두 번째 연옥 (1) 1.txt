"Kueeeeeee!"

Valkyr held on until the end.

Ordinary creatures would have died out of courtesy by now.

It showed how stubborn and obsessive demons were born from such concepts.

"I can't disappear like this...."

"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry."

A woman with pale face and white hair down to her waist hugged Valkyr and shed tears.

Every time her hand stroked the demon's body, his flesh that seemed to regenerate stopped moving.

"How much it must hurt. How painful it must be. Ehehe! I'm sorry. I can't help it... Ehehehe!"

Between her sobbing voice, an unbearable laughter leaked out.

The contrast between her large tearful eyes and her grotesquely twisted mouth was creepy.

Hello. I translated your text from Korean to English as you requested. Here is your translation:

[414] The Second Hell (1)

Arun Mountain Range, located in the northeast of Thormia Kingdom.

This place, full of ominous energy since ancient times, had a sealed demon lord of Valkyr inside it.

Just as magic existed even when people did not know it, the magicians who handled laws were the ones who sealed the demons.

But now, after thousands of years, the will of good faded and Valkyr's evil slowly crept into the gap and began to erode laws.

This is the story of Valkyr's resurrection.

The majesty of Valkyr, who revealed himself in a cave in the mountains by piercing through 20 meters of underground rock, was overwhelming.

His huge body, which resembled

A wide-area healing magic that reaches 100 meters in diameter is a long-term

Special note: Severe manic symptoms

He was a demon who had the status of a Mara in the heavenly realm, which was equivalent to being called a Masin in the human world, but now he was in danger of being annihilated by only 21 humans at the same time as his descent.

Belkir finally realized that he was trapped.

The magicians' abilities were to seal themselves and beat them for eight hours, and they had no room to endure.

As Masin barely managed, Rose, the team leader of Cage B team, looked for the main dealer.

As expected, he was smoking a cigarette in the corner and had no time to play hooky.

"Hey! Don't you come in quickly? Do you know how much this party is per hour? Does the association pay for digging the ground?"

"Ah, that witch."

Tarvan put out his cigarette and looked at Belkir.

He was definitely silent and hardened, making him perfect for extinction.

'Just die, you jingle-jingle bastard.'

As Tarvan spread both hands and rushed to Belkir, a high-pitched sound that pierced his eardrums spread from his palms.

Kaiser Blast.

All the magicians who heard the name scattered in all directions.

As Tarvan's two hands stretched out forward, Belkir's heavy body began to vibrate.

"Remember, humans! I am......!"

Peeeeeer!

At the same time as the explosion, Belkir's figure disappeared without a trace.

The flesh flew around, but even that melted in the heat.

"Mission complete."

It was the result that came out exactly 8 hours and 49 minutes after Cage B team arrived here.

Then, the communication magician who was leaning against the cave wall and sleeping opened his eyes wide.

Information was being output on the crystal ball in front of him.

About four hundred lines of code were needed to deliver a single sentence.

"Team leader. Team leader."

When Rose turned around, the communication magician raised a crystal ball over his palm and said.

"It's a call from the association. Cage B team all gather."

Magic Association.

The corridor on the 18th floor where the president's office is located was crowded with magicians.

Each of them scattered around and waited for the team leader with an uneasy face on Cage B team.

Basically, Cage B team is made up of only the best performers in each field.

They were not exaggerating to say that they were the busiest magicians in the kingdom, so it was natural that they did not like being called after their mission was over.

"What is it, uneasy? I have to go home and see my child quickly. You don't think you're going to do something more here, do you?"

"By the way, why isn't the team leader coming out? Do you know anything, sir?"

Tarvan asked Horkin.

He was the eldest member of Cage B team and the person in charge of order, so he might know something, but he just smiled vaguely.

The president's office door opened and Rose came out. The magicians flocked to her.

As expected, it wasn't a pleasant thing. Her expression wasn't good either.

"Team leader, what did the president say?"

The current president is temporarily held by Rufist, but they didn't care who was president as long as they paid properly.

"It's an urgent mission. I guess you'll have to jump one more time."

No one said anything, but the cold air from their eyes made the corridor uneasy.

Saint Moriac asked.

"Why us? There's Cage A team too."

There is almost no difference in skill between Cage A and Cage B.

Even if they are the best in each field, Torumia's defense power is not so weak that there are no such talents 40 people.

It's just that Cage A team has been breathing for a long time, while Cage B team is made up of members who are hastily put together depending on the situation.

There was bound to be some jealousy in that trivial difference.

If they had to perform this association's mission, it should have been Cage A team instead of them.

"I suggested it too. But right now Cage A team is temporarily unavailable."

Horkin said.

"Because of Gaold."

"That's right. Currently there is a person suspected of being Gaold's personal guard on Cage A team. Until we find out what happened, we are the only cage-level party in the kingdom."

The group ignored the giants and continued their journey through the forest. They soon reached a large clearing where a huge gate stood, guarded by two winged statues.

"This is the entrance to the mainland," Sein explained. "We have to pass through this gate to get to the neutral zone. But be careful, there are many dangers and temptations waiting for us on the other side."

He approached the gate and placed his hand on a metal plate. A voice echoed from the gate.

"Identity confirmed. Sein, a citizen of Heaven, rank 5. You have permission to enter the mainland. Please state your purpose and destination."

Sein cleared his throat and said, "I'm here for information gathering. I'm heading to the city of Luminar, the capital of the neutral zone."

"Information gathering? What kind of information?" The voice asked.

"That's none of your business," Sein snapped. "Just let us through."

"Very well. But be warned, you are responsible for your own actions and consequences. The mainland is not under Heaven's jurisdiction or protection. You may encounter hostile forces or entities that will try to harm you or lure you away from your faith. Do you understand?"

"Yes, yes, I understand. Now open the gate already."

The voice sighed and said, "As you wish. The gate is opening. Please proceed with caution."

The gate slowly opened, revealing a bright light beyond it. Sein gestured for his companions to follow him and stepped into the light.

"Come on, let's go. We don't have much time to waste."

The group followed him through the gate, leaving behind the forest of outcasts and entering a new world of wonders and dangers.
