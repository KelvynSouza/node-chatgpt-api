Tribe of Darkness (1)

The knights escorting Irene eventually couldn't stand it and collapsed on the cold floor.

"What happened?"

Irene asked in disbelief, but even the security captain Benoff couldn't understand the current situation.

'Snow technique? No, it's different.' The knights' expressions, which seemed to have actually been hit, were filled with clear pain.

"Don't worry. There's no shock to the body."

If the heart technique had really been activated, their bodies would have been shattered, not just fallen.

'Even so, I didn't know they were so weak.'

Lian was disappointed.

It was true that he had become stronger while crossing the desert, but even considering this, the knights' skills were below standard.

"Okay."

Irene changed her mind.

"It seems you have some skills. Take care of my escort. From today, protect me 24 hours a day."

As Lian said, she didn't want to die.

'I received a warning letter.'

If the content is true, Lian would have been uncomfortable when Irene died.

"If you want to be escorted by me, apologize for your rudeness."

She wasn't a grudge-holding personality, but if she wanted to escort properly, she needed to change her attitude.

"Apologize? What did I do wrong to apologize?"

Lian turned around as if there was nothing more to say and walked towards the door.

"Al, I got it! I got it!"

Even though she was stubborn, she was quick to change her stance, which was rather villainous.

"I'm sorry. Is that okay?"

"Say exactly what you're sorry for." Irene was disgusted.

"Can't you be a little cool? That's why I hate you guys. You keep nagging."

"Do you want me to nag more?"

She didn't want to have a deeper relationship anymore.

"I'm a little...

Irene turned her head and spoke.

"I was arrogant. Do you have to hear that?"

Lian, who thought it was a good start, nodded and reached out.

"Okay. You said you received a warning letter? Show me."

When Irene took out a letter from her bosom, Benoff approached Lian's side.

The next victim is you.

Lian tilted his head at the short sentence made by cutting out the letters of the newspaper.

"What is this? It looks like the criminal wrote it, right?"

Benoff shook his head.

"The possibility is slim. First of all, the serial killer has never sent a murder warning letter. He wouldn't suddenly reveal himself, right?"

"Then it could be a prank. If it's a prank, it's meticulous. Considering that the minister has many enemies. Political tricks or...

Irene stood up, supporting her waist with her hand.

"No. My dad doesn't have any enemies. Because he's a person who can't be surpassed by anyone. And I think that warning is probably true."

Lian handed over the warning letter and asked.

"Why do you think so?"

"Do you know what the characteristics of the victims have been so far? Between the ages of 10 and 20. Beautiful and wealthy. Most of all, the skin is so good that you don't need makeup."

"So what?"

Irene pointed to herself in frustration.

"It's me, me! Pretty! Rich! The skin is soft! If the murderer has to kill someone, is there anyone other than me?" It was like protesting to be killed.

"There is a point in Miss Irene's words. One of the characteristics of the victims is that they didn't wear makeup."

Lian leaned his chin and fell into thought.

"A human being extremely sensitive to smell...

"It means a vampire. Certain chemical substances that humans can detoxify become weaknesses for them."

"It could be a strategy to turn attention to vampires. Then it's meticulous."

"That's right. The problem is that there are no witnesses yet. It's getting harder to solve because we can't narrow down the investigation network."

"I understand."

She roughly understood the situation.

"Today is exactly the 7th day. I will keep this place for now."

A look of relief appeared in Irene's eyes.

"Um, then I'll ask for a favor. It's hard to concentrate the troops because this warning could be fake."

"Don't worry. I'm enough on my own."

If the knight of Maha was guarding, the Bark family would not have to worry for a while.

Benoff said to Irene.

"Miss. Please follow Lian's words. You won't be able to find such a skilled person anywhere."

"Looking at what this old man does."

As Benoff left the mansion with a refreshed taste, Irene revealed her true colors and spoke.

"I'm going shopping from now on, so get ready to go out. Please take off that rustic clothes and tuxedo... Kyak!"

Since Lian also had true colors, he climbed the stairs with Irene on his shoulder.

"You're talking about shopping. From now on, don't step out of the room."

"Pervert! Touching a woman's body without permission! I'll tell my dad later!"

"Please do that."

Since it was the first time anyone had swung Irene like this, the butler opened his mouth blankly.

"What are you doing? Guide me to the room."

"Oh, yes!"

At Lian's chin gesture, the butler who ran up the stairs guided him to the room at the end of the corridor.

"Mom!"

Irene, who was buried in the bed, immediately turned her body and smiled with one leg bent.

"Tell me honestly. You're feeling great right now, aren't you? You're feeling pleasure while handling a pretty girl like me?"

Lian looked back at the butler.

"Bring all the mirrors in the house. And the knights scattered in the hall, tell them to come to me as soon as they wake up."

"Understood. But why the mirror..."

"It's to prepare for infiltration." Vampires can make their appearance transparent by controlling human vision.

However, it was only the eyes of creatures, and they could not hide their appearance reflected in the mirror.

"Understood."

While the ordinary butlers brought 30 mirrors and removed the corners in Irene's room, Lian rearranged the positions of the knights.

'If it's like this...'

He dusted off his hands and turned to look at the bed, where Irene was looking at him with a chubby expression.

"Well, do you have anything to say?"

"Can I call my friends?"

"No."

When Irene sulked and bowed her head, Lian spoke in a low voice as if to comfort her.

"Hold on. It's a matter of life and death."

"I'm scared to be alone. If I'm really targeted by a murderer, then I..."

Even though she pretended to be confident, she was still a young girl.

"That's why you should listen. If I'm by your side, you won't die."

If she died, I would die.

'He's not coming.'

As the bell ringing midnight from the first floor of the mansion was heard, Lian's eyes narrowed.

'Is it a joke after all?'

"Um... Can I go to the bathroom?"

When Irene twisted her body and spoke, Lian pointed to the jar in the corner of the room.

"It's there."

"Are you really a pervert? How can a grown woman do her business in such a place!"

"Then go with me."

"No! Never! This is not a trivial matter, so...

Lian sighed.

"So what do you want?"

"I'll just go and come back quickly. Okay?" Irene's expression, sweating cold sweat, seemed to burst into a big deal at any moment.

"Follow me."

In front of the bathroom, Irene confirmed again.

"You must never come close. Got it? Wait at the end of the corridor."

"Go in quickly. Aren't you in a hurry?"

When she stomped her feet and closed the door, Lian leaned against the door and sat down.

"......!"

When I heard the sound of seeing a big deal, I couldn't help but chuckle.

'Do all kids these days do that?'

Well, when Lian was young, the world didn't feel heavy like now.

A moment later, I heard the sound of water.

"Whew, I almost died."

'You're pretty good.'

As I turned around and looked at the bed, Irene was looking at me with a chubby expression.

"Well, do you have anything to say?"

"Can I call my friends?"

"No."

When Irene sulked and bowed her head, Lian spoke in a low voice as if to comfort her.

"Hold on. It's a matter of life and death."

"I'm scared to be alone. If I'm really targeted by a murderer, then I..."

"I was so nervous that my bowel movements were too active.

'Surely they wouldn't have eaten it?'

Thinking that if they did, they would be people I would have to cut ties with, I approached the sink.

'I should go out a little later. It's a rare freedom.'

As I washed my face, soaked in cold sweat, with water and turned to the mirror, there was a man standing there.

"Huh?"

Irene's eyes, who was reflexively getting water again, widened.

'What, what is it?'

Irene, who didn't dare to look at the mirror again, slowly turned her body and quickly turned her head.

There was no one there.

"Phew, I guess so."

Then, remembering Lian's words, she looked back at the mirror slowly, scared again.

A handsome man in a suit was smirking with his red lips pursed.

"Uh, uh."

"Shh."

The man in the mirror put his index finger on his lips.

'Save, save me!'

She wanted to scream with all her might in her head, but her breath wouldn't come out as if her throat was blocked.

The man who approached silently propped her shoulders with his hands, and the cold breath touched her neck.

'He's biting. He's biting.'

Through the mirror, the man's fangs were clearly visible.

"Mister!"

At the same time as she screamed, the door was smashed and Lian rushed in with a great sword.

'Vampire.'

The bathroom was empty, but in the mirror on the side, the man was turning around.

As soon as he located and swung his great sword, a dark smoke pushed against the wall and revealed its true form.

"Mister! That guy, he keeps...

"Get out."

The energy in his voice was different, so Irene immediately escaped through the broken door.

"I can't miss it!"

As soon as the man, whose lower body had turned into dark smoke, went outside, Lian also kicked the ground and swung his sword.

"Annoying guy!"

The vampire, angry at losing his target, spun around Lian like a whirlwind.

'Fast.'

Among the demons he had faced so far, there were only those of the rank of division commander or above who had this speed.

'But.'

Lian's sword is a straight line of the shortest distance.

'As soon as you detect it, cut it off.' As the sword swung at the speed of a flash, a bang exploded and the vampire was split in two.

"Kuuuuu!"

However, the two bodies turned back into smoke and gathered in the middle of the corridor.

'Half body, half soul. It's definitely tricky.' Even so, the fact that he executed the fire god technique just before his body was split means that he is a top among vampires.

"......Almas?"

The vampire's eyes twitched.

"It was a hunter."

Pure-blooded vampires have a pedigree.

"No. It's a wandering swordsman."

The injection rod of the true demon, the injection of the rod Almas, the injection of Almas Vesica is it.

"But how do you know the lineage of darkness?"

"You hear a lot of stories living in the desert."

The organization of the Ain tribe of Radum, Spectrum's interior minister, was also an Almas class.

"Hong, such a lowly human... The vampire caused an afterimage and moved.

"How dare you discuss Mara!"

All the glass windows in the corridor were broken, and the walls were carved with knife and nail marks as if there was no cause.

"It's over there! Catch the criminal!"

At the end of the corridor, the self-proclaimed Irene's bodyguard was climbing the stairs with a long sword.

"Don't come!"

As the saying goes, they were brave because they were ignorant, and they couldn't see the battle, so they had no room for fear.

"Where are you! Come out!"

As soon as the knights, who were captivated by their conscience, swung their swords at the air, three necks fell off.

"Uaaaaa!"

Now they were scared, and they all turned their backs and ran back to Irene, leaving the handshake.

"Idiots!"

Even if they were knights, shouldn't they choose death to protect their employer?

"I got it!"

A huge smoke rose vertically in Irene's field of vision, and the vampire's face fell like a waterfall.

'Supernatural transcendence!'

With a bang, the wind exploded, and Lian, who had blocked Irene's front before she knew it, swung his sword horizontally.

"Kueee!"

However, the vampire, who had been cut in half, turned into smoke again and gathered in the middle of the corridor.

'Half body, half soul. It's definitely tricky.' Even so, the fact that he executed the fire god technique just before his body was split means that he is a top among vampires.

"......Almas?"

The vampire's eyes twitched.

A huge smoke rose vertically in Irene's field of vision, and the vampire's face fell like a waterfall.

'Supernatural transcendence!'

With a bang, the wind exploded, and Lian, who had blocked Irene's front before she knew it, swung his sword horizontally.
