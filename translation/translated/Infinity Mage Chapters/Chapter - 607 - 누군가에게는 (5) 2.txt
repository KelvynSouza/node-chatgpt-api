[607] To Someone (5)

A sense of dissonance occurred in the moment when Armand's blade, wrapped around Shirone's body, formed a skeleton.

Unlike when the robe covered the body unconsciously when the Diamond Armor was activated, Shirone could clearly feel the fibrous flow emanating from the blade, and on the contrary, Nade was approaching at too fast a speed.

'I can't match the time.'

Before transforming into the state of Diamond Armor, Nade's claw scraped from Shirone's crown to her face.

'I have to go back!'

As soon as the Spirit Bomb was manifested, the reality of the burning face scattered into a nightmare that had not happened, and the nails passed in front of Shirone's eyes, who had widely bent her upper body.

It was like a lightning strike.

"Darn it...!"

Although he avoided the attack by turning back the reality of one second in the past, Armand also regressed the event to the state before the Diamond Armor was activated.

'Let's run away!'

He cast teleportation with all his might, but the spark magic stuck Nade at the destination like the movement of electrons jumping over space.

"Krrrrr!"

As if he couldn't bear the saturation state of electricity himself, Nade once again spread lightning in all directions.

The power realized by perfectly matching the Spirit Zone with electricity was beyond the concept of artificiality, and a huge lightning bolt struck the ground as all the charges in the atmosphere were discharged.

Kwarrung!

There is no reason.

It's just a huge lightning bolt.

"Darn it! What on earth did you do to get into that state!"

Iruki, who rolled down the mountain slope holding Oscar, shouted.

If his mind had already been harmonized with electricity, it would have been impossible to escape.

"I... didn't know."

Oscar, who had fed Nade a lightning bolt, made a cowardly excuse, but the situation was not even enough to get angry at him.

"Stay here! We have to save Shirone!"

Shirone, who seemed to burn at any moment in Nade's hands, appeared in front of Iruki, who climbed up the mountain slope.

'That can't be canceled.'

Only God can do it.

"Nade! Get a hold of yourself!"

Shirone shouted without giving up, but now even her voice was not delivered.

Thunder and lightning fell, and Nade, dressed in plasma clothes, suddenly approached.

'Diamond Armor!'

As soon as he recognized the future of one second later with the Spirit Bomb, the golden body line, which contained numerous changes of Armand, spread out grotesquely.

"Hrrrrrr!"

Armand was equipped with a hair's breadth difference, and the artificial brain installed outside of Armand activated the Antithesis.

'There's no effect.'

There was no change in stealing the will from a being without a motive for action, and Nade's claw hit the side.

"Kuk!"

The silver metal of the Ringer's armor, which was nailed, rang, but the shock of the electric shock coming through the conductor was considerable.

'Shotgun Movement!'

Seven photon cannons excluding Shirone spread out in all directions, but none of them could even touch Nade's fur.

'Then...!'

Shirone, who had distanced herself, gritted her teeth and swung her tentacles.

Two tentacles, creating a black afterimage, swirled and attacked Nade at a speed that could not be seen with the naked eye.

With a thud, the tentacles caught on Nade's arms crossed in an X shape.

"What...!"

When he clenched his two fists, the tentacles that had been burned with a puffing sound were cut off.

'That's the problem.'

Iruki bit his lip.

The power of mana fusion is close to disaster, but what is more serious is the fusion itself.

'It's not caught by looking with the eyes.'

Strictly sensory acceptance and reaction.

For example, it was like reacting and avoiding the moment a stone flying from behind touched the hair.

'That's the fear of 100% affinity.'

If the Spirit Zone is electricity, the reaction speed of the senses has already exceeded the realm of life.

It was the basis for Iruki's judgment that it would be difficult to catch Nade with the current Shirone.

"Kraaaa!"

Nevertheless, there is a blind spot.

As Nade's control is eroded by mana fusion, it tends to move away from human thought.

"I didn't... know."

Oscar, who had fed Nade a lightning bolt, made a cowardly excuse, but the situation was not even enough to get angry at him.

"Stay here! We have to save Shirone!"

Shirone, who seemed to burn at any moment in Nade's hands, appeared in front of Iruki, who climbed up the mountain slope.

[Translated block]
As expected, he did not move out of arrogance, but was naturally sucking in the charge of plasma.

"Nade! Please...!"

A flash, and thousands of wire-like lightning bolts sprang from Nade's body.

In the intense light that could blind the eyes, while Shiro and Iruki turned their heads briefly, Nade had already arrived in front of Oscar.

"Ah! Save me!"

Shiro and Iruki threw their bodies at the same time, but Nade's hand was already aiming at Oscar with electricity.

"Nade! No!"

"Kaaaaaaa!"

When Nade was about to burn Oscar's skull, Iruki shouted.

"It's the life that senior Liz gave!"

The electricity surrounding Nade blinked, and the clawed hand stopped right in front of Oscar's eyes.

"Huuuuuuuuk!"

Oscar, who had already lost his mind, burst into tears like a child and trembled his limbs, while Iruki shouted again.

"If you cross the line, you can't come back!"

The charge surrounding Nade began to stabilize.

"Senior Liz is......"

A broken voice leaked out.

"She was my everything."

"Please save me! Please save me!"

It was just a matter of enduring with reason, and death was scary for a wizard.

And all that was left for Oscar, who had already lost his reason, was the pitiful instinct to want to protect his life.

"That kid, he really controlled it."

The violent awakening of the magic power hit by lightning was different from what Iruki saw, but Nade suppressed it again this time.

"Shiro."

Nade, who turned to look at Shiro, had a strange memory in his head as if it were someone else's.

'I tried to kill her.'

Nade, wearing Arman's robe and on high alert, sobbed at Shiro.

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

As soon as the words were over, Nade collapsed from his knees.

"Nade! Wake up! Nade!"

Shiro ran and shook him, but only a tear fell from his closed eyes.

* * *

"Uhm."

The first thing Nade saw when he woke up from sleep was the dormitory ceiling blinking between his eyelids.

"......"

He didn't even think about getting up, trying to reconnect the scattered thoughts in his head.

"Huh? Iruki! Nade woke up!"

Shiro, who opened the door and came in, called Iruki in the hallway.

"Huh? Really."

Iruki's smiling face came into Nade's still unmoving view.

"Did you sleep well?"

"......How long has it been?"

Shiro said.

"A day and a half. It's almost evening now."

"I see......"

Nade, who was lost in thought again, asked after a while.

"What about Oscar?"

"He's alive."

Nade thought this would be the most curious.

"No, I remember. What happened?"

Shiro exchanged glances with Iruki.

"I went to the square in the morning and checked it out, and it was posted on the bulletin board. Oscar passed as a special admission."

"......"

Whether he was obsessed with it until the end after going through all that trouble, or whether it was naturally processed because he was out of his mind, there was no way to know, but it was probably the former.

"Oscar is also a wizard, so he must have made the best judgment."

"Yeah. Adults...... live hard."

Iruki said.

"There's nothing more important than making a living."

"I talked to him for a while after you fainted, but Oscar didn't intend to do that from the beginning. He was going to come alone after being proposed by the daughter of the head of the water society, but Liz insisted on using her vacation......"

"He did that to meet me."

Nade understood her feelings.

"What are you going to do now? Do you want to go to the press room with us? If you're still angry......"

Nade's head turned sideways.

"I don't care. Whether you get a job at the association or not. I'm just worried about senior Liz. She must have left by now?"
[Translated block]


"Sure. Now you must know about Oscar."

Nade closed his eyes.

"Just let me rest a bit more. I'm tired."

Shirone pulled the blanket up to his neck.

"Yeah, sleep a little more. We'll have dinner and bring some of your stuff."

There was no answer, and Shirone and Iruki carefully left the room.

An hour later.

Shirone opened the door with a tray of dinner.

"Nade, at least eat this. Huh?"

Iruki, who followed him in, also looked around blankly.

The bed was neatly made, and the curtain was fluttering in the wind from the open window.

* * *

'He must have already left......'

Nevertheless, Nade headed to the Dolphin Inn.

Even though he had already emptied his mind, his heart sank the moment he peeked inside the inn through the window.

"Senior Liz......"

The back of Liz, who was sitting at the bar with her head down and empty bottles next to her, was visible.

Thinking that she still had something left here, Nade's eyes welled up with tears.

"That woman... isn't she drinking too much?"

"Leave her alone. She must have been dumped."

Hearing the murmuring behind her, Liz emptied another strong drink.

Her body naturally bent over, and her thin wrist was barely holding up her heavy head.

"Why......"

Why did he come here following Oscar?

Why was he the one who came to mind at the peak of happiness, with his loved one and an engagement ceremony ahead?

"Kuuuuuu!"

The warehouse was blown away without a trace, and neither Wiz nor the wizard were visible.

Nade, who was hit by Ultrix's lightning, couldn't suppress the burning pain from his mind.

'Damn! This is the first time this has happened!'

Sometimes instinctive magic fusion occurs, but the lightning coming from outside was uncontrollable.

"Uaaaaa!"

As the electricity was discharged, Liz's surroundings were scorched dark.

"Run!"

Nade desperately suppressed his strength and squeezed out his words.

"Nade! What's going on?"

"Go quickly! If you stay here, you'll die too!"

"What about you then?"

She couldn't run away with the person who saved her life in front of her.

"It doesn't matter. I'm already......"

Nade, whose thoughts had arrived somewhere, twisted one corner of his mouth and said.

"I'm a guy who's not worth living anyway."

There was no meaning to life for him, who had been abandoned by his family and became a monster.

"No. I'm going with you."

Liz, who had made up her mind, approached.

"Are you crazy? Don't come near me."

The moment she touches him, she will be electrocuted, and she can't stand it if she's not in a state of magic fusion.

"You just have to endure. You're enduring now."

Liz slowly reached out and touched Nade's shoulder.

"Kuuuuuuk!"

As he desperately suppressed his strength thinking that he couldn't kill her, a vicious bloodline rose on his face.

"Stop it...... Please. I can't hold on any longer......"

"Then we'll die together."

Liz, who confirmed the effect, closed her eyes tightly and hugged Nade tightly.

"Uaaaaa!"

Nade, who cut off the discharge of electricity at the same time, writhed in pain.

"Let go! Just go!"

"You can do it! Hang in there a little longer!"

"There's no reason to live anyway! It's better for a guy like me to die!"

"Why don't you have a reason to live! You saved me!"

"Stupid, that's......"

At the moment when his mental explosion spread out his limbs, Liz kissed him.

"Huh!"

As the soft lips of a woman were transmitted through the nerves of his whole body, his rampaging mind began to regain stability little by little.

Nade hugged Liz's waist, and the two shivered with infinite freedom and entrusted everything to each other's actions.

Blue electricity.

Liz defined it that way.

It was her first kiss, which would remain as an afterimage forever, no matter how much time passed.

"Huk! Huk!"
