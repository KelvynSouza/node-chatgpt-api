***

The Holy War.

The sight of the 12 leaders who rule the world gathered in one place was quite strange.

A single word from them could shake the world, and the agenda agreed upon in this place could cause a massive shift.

The President of the Republic of Kotoria, where the Holy War is held, is sitting in the chair, but the overall structure was that the Seven Kings were watching the Three Emperors while the King was playing the role of the audience.

Woorin, the leader of the Valkyrie, closed the document.

"Then let's decide the supply rate of the Devil's Bullet like this......"

She paused for a moment, but naturally continued her words as if she was catching her breath.

"Shall we take a break for about 10 minutes?"

No one showed it, but the meeting had already been going on for 7 hours.

'That's the problem.'

The reason why Woorin stopped talking was because of Gustav Habits 17, who was sitting across the huge round table.

'How long are you going to stare at me?'

Since the Holy War began, Habits has not opened his mouth once and has only been staring at Woorin without even turning his gaze.

Even now, during the declared break, he was the same, and his action of shaking his chair while sitting crookedly was no different from the beginning.

'Provocation. No, it's not that.'

He's analyzing.

When faced with a gaze that seemed to capture every single hair, she didn't even want to think about what he was imagining.

"Hehe, come to think of it...... Congratulations on becoming the new owner of the Empire."

Meyer, the king of Zive, who represents the Central Continent, offered a handshake to Habits.

"......"

However, Habits did not even turn his head and continued to shake his chair.

"Hmm, hmm."

Meyer's embarrassment was indescribable, and the soldiers of the 'Shinjang', the Zive Guard, who were lined up behind him, all put their hands on the handle of the sword attached to their left side.

"Hehe, stop that. In a place like this......"

Who would dare to humiliate the king of Zive, but this place was a holy war full of such people.

'Arrogant kid. It wasn't long ago that we were in the same position.'

Until Habits 16 died, Habits 17 was just a king who ruled part of the empire.

"So what kind of person was he?"

When Moon Ryong, the ruler of the Moon Kingdom, asked, Jin Kangdo, the emperor of Jincheon, also showed interest.

"He graduated from the Zive Kingdom."

Meyer acted as if he was embarrassed.

"There's nothing special about him. He was just a student, and now he's become an enemy of humanity."

The eyes of the Seven Kings' leaders changed unfavorably due to the attitude of blocking information in advance.

Just by this alone, the atmosphere cooled down, and Woorin made eye contact with Habits for the first time.

"I have one question."

Habits, who seemed to have no reaction, suddenly opened his mouth.

"How long has it been?"

Behind Habits, four people were sitting on the floor in different postures.

"7 hours and 48 minutes?"

The woman who seemed to be asking back was kneeling, and her outfit was so ridiculous that it could be called a clown.

She was dressed in a ridiculously flashy dress, her face was painted white, and her eyes were always big because she had cut off her eyelids.

She drew her eyelashes in black, with three lines below and three lines above.

Gustav 4th Art, Combat Doll Natasha.

If there was another sight to see in the Holy War, it was the unique military flag of the guards protecting each country's king.

However, Habits did not bring the guards and only brought four generals to the Holy War.

'Those were the ones I only heard rumors about......'

The eyes of many people who were paying attention without showing it finally moved to the back of Habits.

'The four arts that the King of Desire leads.'

Although Habits was not normal, among those who were led by the world's greatest charisma, there were many talented people.

The Four Arts were the chosen talents among them, and they were the ones who reached the peak in one field.

"7 hours and 48 minutes..."

Habits, who had been muttering softly, finally straightened his chair and rested his chin on the table.

"Mitochondrial Eve, surprisingly impatient, the woman who is the Empress of Kashan."

The bodies of 100 wind generals vibrated, causing a strong wind to blow in the temple.

"Stop."

The wave of air stopped in an instant.

"There's nothing particularly worth waiting for. It's only natural to feel uncomfortable when you stare at me like that."

Woorin responded in a textbook manner.

"Do you live by receiving a man's genes?"

It was a fact known to any representative of the temple, but it was an unwritten rule that could never be mentioned.

"How about receiving mine?"

Lightning struck in Gando's eyes, but Woorin was not shaken by such a thing.

"The predecessor also made such a proposal."

It was a secret file that no one knew.

"But I refused because it didn't meet the level. Let alone you, who are inferior to the predecessor...."

Habits yawned.

"It would be fun. I'm curious about what kind of guy will be born. What happens if my daughter gives birth to my daughter again?"

'He's not listening. Is there no trauma?'

He deliberately mentioned his father to stimulate his sense of inferiority, but he couldn't feel it at all.

'It's close to madness. The climax of narcissism.'

Habits the 16th, the predecessor, was a person who had a sense of reason even though he was immersed in desire.

'A monster made by the times.'

Woorin, who has lived through the history of mankind, knows how evil and cruel humans are.

But Habits in front of him now felt like all of them combined.

"Hmm, so you have three daughters, and those three have three more.... No, use your sons to have daughters...."

Ignoring Habits, who kept mumbling, Woorin proceeded with the meeting.

"Then let's get into the main agenda. It's about the budget allocation of each country for Valkyrie operation and altar defense."

Even in the temple, it's a principle to promote the interests of one's own country.

Therefore, it was a textbook to bring out such sensitive issues when everyone's fatigue was accumulated.

'It's a real fight from now on.'

At that moment, when the representatives put strength in their eyes to gain even a little advantage, Habits shouted.

"That's it!"

The serious atmosphere was shattered.

"You're farming! Just hang them up and make them give birth to one a day!"

"You son of a bitch!"

Emperor Jingang of Jinchun stood up at the same time as Gando, and hit the table.

Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

"Miss, why?"

Yedal's lips were visible in Yedal's eyes.

"It's a fight between Habits and Woorin. If you carelessly aim an arrow at Jinchun, everything will be overwritten."

It was a self-evident fact that the one who moves first among the three pillars called Samhwanggye will be attacked.

"Representative of Jinchun, thank you for speaking on behalf of me, something I can't say as a woman."

Woorin showed respect to Jinkang and proposed an alliance, and officially provoked Habits.

"I think the same. This place is an important place to determine the future of the world. If you can't get involved, how about wiping your bottom in the bathroom?"

"You reckless thing!"

The middle-aged man sitting behind Habits jumped onto the table and tore his top wide open.

"Gustav~!"

All the skinny ribs were exposed to the dark nipples.

"Habits!"

He, who was convulsing and bending his body, glared at Woorin with his eyes raised
