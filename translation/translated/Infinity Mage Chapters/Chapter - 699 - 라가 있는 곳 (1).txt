[699] Where there is Raga (1)

Shirone and Uorin did not move until Lian and Kido passed through the Metagate.

The reason why time was flowing slowly, even though they were not particularly missing each other, was because they intuitively felt that they would never be excluded from each other's lives.

'She has matured.'

That's what it meant to live as the Emperor of Kassan.

She met him when she was fourteen and is still a tender age of sixteen, but she has grown into a beautiful woman with a lot of youthful charm.

Thanks to Shirone, who was receiving all the attention, Lian and Kido were free to observe Uorin.

'Is that woman Teraje?'

Thinking that she was the most powerful person in the world, even the space that made her seemed to ripple.

'It's definitely incomparable to Orkamp.'

Even though she heard that she was a daughter, she could assert that she did not inherit any genes.

"Uh, so......"

Before she could say anything, Uorin quickly ran over and hugged Shirone.

"Brother Shirone!"

It was an unexpected situation, and Gando, who came into the room late, blinked his eyes as if he couldn't believe it.

"Do you know how worried I was, in case something happened to my brother?"

Shirone, who was looking down at Uorin's desperate eyes, hugged her tightly and said.

"Thank you, Uorin."

Although it was buried in his chest and could not be seen, a slight shock was contained in Uorin's eyes.

"I heard the story, you saved me. I don't know how to repay this favor."

Kido turned his head as if to ask if it was okay, but Lian just carefully watched the situation.

Gando called out cautiously.

"Your Majesty."

Hwangseong Aganos was a perfect fortress with all defense facilities for magic, law, and physics.

Also, Uorin was the highest human being protected by the close, medium, and long-range guards and the wind general.

But now she was in a situation where she was hugging someone, ignoring all those defenses.

'That's why I tried to stop it.'

The fact that Uorin left the Metagate in Kazra meant that she handed over the most expensive life in the world to someone else.

'To call Shirone here.'

Jealousy.

Gando, who had a word in mind for a moment, shook his head.

'I have to protect Her Majesty.'

Gando, who made a decision, was about to approach, but Uorin first huddled her shoulders and slowly pulled out her body.

She, who pushed Shirone's chest gently with her slender fingers and smiled with a different face than before.

"You've become strong, Shirone."

Not calculating means there is no fear.

Gando's steps stopped, and Shirone looked at Uorin's face, who had taken off her mask.

'Was it a lie after all?'

Why?

Even though he had already anticipated it, why did he feel disappointed?

"Thanks to your help. Armand too, and also for saving me at the Moratorium."

Shirone asked belatedly.

"But...... can you speak comfortably......?"

If the child's play was over, the sixteen-year-old girl in front of him was not a girl, but a Teraje who had a history of thousands of years.

"Of course. It's also ticklish to be awkward with each other. Sit here. Gando, bring the tea."

Since he was born for the purpose of Teraje from the beginning, he did not feel betrayed while watching Gando heading to the tea room.

"Where, the blue hair must be Lian......"

Uorin, who sat on the chair with her legs crossed, looked at Kido and raised one eyebrow as if asking for an explanation.

Kido pointed to himself, showing his teeth.

"I'm Kido of Predation. The king of goblins."

Kido thought that this degree of title was natural when dealing with the ruler of Kassan.

"Hmm, the king of goblins."

Uorin, who had been looking up and down Kido's appearance, protruded her lower lip and said.

"You look very funny."

"......"

Seeing Kido's expression, she burst into laughter and turned to Shirone and asked.

"I thought I would stop by Kazura someday. How about it, have you shaken off your guilt now?"

"I just told the truth. That's why it caused a commotion."

Kando served tea while talking about what happened in Kazura.

"I know I did cruel things to them. But I didn't want to leave any room for doubt. Otherwise, I couldn't live my life."

Woorin said, looking into his teacup.

"How foolish. The prince is not the one you killed."

"But he was killed because of me."

"That's why you're the last in the Ivory Tower candidate."

When Shiroe squinted his eyes, Woorin looked up at the ceiling and said,

"If you don't care, that's it, isn't it? Guilt? No matter how you were born, you are you."

"But......"

"Yeah, it's not easy. That's what emotions are. They complicate everything. Good and evil are just a matter of emotion. That's why the one who controls emotions controls humans."

Woorin lowered his head again.

"There are plenty of psychopaths without emotions in this world. But there are very few people who can make cold decisions while embracing emotions. Is it humans first, or truth first? You and I diverge from there."

Teraje seemed to know everything humanity knew.

"What kind of person is Nane?"

"First of all, she's strong. I can't guarantee the result even if I face her."

It was a more modest evaluation than Tsuoi.

"But Nane's real talent lies elsewhere. She moves forward scrutinizing everything like you, but she doesn't judge right or wrong. So she's very fast. How fast is it......"

Woorin smiled.

"Now Nane beats you."

It was just 5 seconds after the first evaluation.

"......I see."

I felt like I knew what kind of person Nane was.

"The hearts of Orkamp and Eliza, your heart, numerous emotions. You always think in your head and follow the best conclusion. But Nane acts first. What humans can do, what they can't do, whatever outrageous things, she first tries and draws a conclusion. So the realization is accurate and surprisingly fast. She's just a machine that sucks up the truth."

It was a strong expression that was creepy.

"For example, this. You wiped out La Enemy's random numbers with the foam of the event, but if it was Nane, she would have accepted La Enemy with the same random numbers."

In the midst of the silence flowing with the overwhelming strength of a competitor beyond expectation, Kido pointed to Woorin.

"What about you? Who would you vote for among the three Ivory Tower candidates?"

Woorin squinted his eyes like a seagull.

"Ahaha, that's a difficult question. In front of the party."

"You don't care about that kind of thing anyway, do you?"

Kido, who had realized that Woorin was different from ordinary humans just by a short conversation.

"The vote of the stars? Seventeen votes for Nane, nine votes for Jinsung Eum. And Shiroe received only one vote. If it were me......"

As Woorin brought his finger to his lips and fell into thought, everyone's eyes were filled with tension.

"I probably wouldn't have given a vote to Nane or Jinsung Eum."

A shadow fell on Lian's face.

'Is it still insufficient?'

It was the evaluation of Mitochondrial Eve, not someone else, so it couldn't be ignored.

"But if I had to bet all my assets......"

Expectation rose again in Kido's eyes.

"Of course, it's Nane. How much is my property. It's natural to go for the one with the highest probability, right?"

'This woman is also a pervert.'

Woorin, who scratched his head and stuck out his tongue, was so mischievous that it was unbearable.

Shiroe couldn't help but lower his head in a gloomy mood without showing his face.

'That's how strong she is.'

Woorin, who was looking at him affectionately, said,

"But...... if I had to bet my life?"

She pointed to Shiroe.

"Then I would definitely vote for you, Shiroe."

Shirone suddenly raised her head, realizing something.

"That's it. The opinions of others, on which nothing is staked, are not important at all. Thoughts change countless times depending on reputation, money, and life. Only you can evaluate your life."

A hot feeling surged in Shirone's chest.

"Nane has a destructive experience. Jinsung Eum has unwavering firmness. Of course, both are fast. But you have the prudence not to judge right and wrong rashly. So it's okay to be a little slow. Because that will lead you to 100 percent, not 99 percent."

Shirone clenched her fists.

'For perfection.'

"You just chose a slightly difficult path. I don't know who voted for you, but that person must have thought the same as me. If you have to stake your life... that's the only real thing. You are fully qualified to become a star."

Lian looked at Shirone, whose eyes were hot.

'The Queen of Kashan is huge.'

There are only a handful of people in the world who can comfort Shirone with their hearts.

Shirone took a deep breath to calm her mind.

"Thank you, Uorin. I really gained confidence. I will definitely pass the Ivory Tower test."

"Haha, of course you should. Who picked the person."

"Huh?"

Uorin's confidence was to shake her head ambiguously after saying it outright.

"No. So now let's get to the point, you want to know where Ra Enemy is, right?"

"Oh, right."

That was the task.

"Gando, bring paper and pen."

While Gando was running errands, Shirone asked.

"Do you know where Ra Enemy is?"

"No, unfortunately I don't know the exact location. I can guess roughly."

"Guess?"

Uorin, who put the paper and pen brought by Gando on the table, started explaining.

"Even in Kashan, the location of Ra Enemy is important. So I traced history as soon as the third reset started. But I ate it properly. What I figured out was just a case of Ra Enemy, not the real thing."

It was a miracle that Shirone caught Ra Enemy, who was even fooled by Uorin.

"So I used a different method."

"A different method?"

Uorin twirled the pen and said.

"I investigated all the history of all humans except Ra Enemy."

Shirone's mouth gaped open.

"All... did you investigate?"

A circle the size of a fist was drawn on the white paper.

"It's not as difficult as you think. Humans have free will, but there are biological patterns. This is called causality."

Dozens of dots were dotted inside the circle, and Uorin connected them with lines.

"Some people spend their whole lives in their hometown, and some people wander around the world. Some people get married and set up a family, and some people move because their house is ruined."

Shirone watched the lines being drawn at a tremendous speed.

It seemed like she was just shaking her pen on the paper as if she was scribbling, and many lines filled the circle.

"But..."

As the lines continued to fill the circle, it highlighted the part that was left white.

"If you analyze the lines of billions of units, eventually areas where causality is cut off will appear."

Uorin, who put down the pen, crossed her arms.

"In other words, a region where you have entered but never come out again. I call this a hole in causality."

A place where you can never escape once you enter.

"Where is that?"

Uorin spread three fingers and said.

"Jessica. Andre. Pytaros."

At the name that anyone would hear once in their life, Shirone, who was looking at the paper, raised her head.

"No way?"

"Yes. The three great labyrinths of the world. The real Ra Enemy is there."
