Scramble Royale (5)

Only after the alliance team left did Nade's face relax.

"Phew, it ended up like this. I'm sorry. I should have accepted it in the first place."

Iruki didn't care.

"It's something we have to go through once anyway. We also have a reason why we can't give up Istas. But what about the personnel? Do you have anyone in mind?"

Shirone and Nade spoke at the same time.

"Amy."

Iruki nodded.

"Right. Actually, I also thought the same and set such a condition. But the problem is that Amy's rank is already 5th. We have to appeal to her emotions."

"I'll ask her."

If it was someone other than Shirone, there was no chance.

"Okay, Shirone will take care of Amy. What about the remaining two people?"

Silence flowed.

"Do you really have no one in mind?"

Nade propped his chin and spoke.

"Hmm, there are many candidates. There's the Canis team, the Dante team, and Boyle is okay too. His summoning magic can check Pisho."

Iruki shook his head.

"We have to get it from outside, but it's a shady thing that's not good to be known. We have to contact only those who think they have a sure chance. In that sense, Canis is dangerous. Because he's after Shirone."

Shirone spoke.

"I can't say that Boyle has any particular merit compared to other candidates. Dante is likely to move as a team."

Nade looked gloomy.

"Then who do we get?"

"What about Dorothy in that sense?"

Shirone looked back at Iruki.

"Dorothy?"

Nade, who sensed something, squinted his eyes and shouted.

"You son of a...! I knew you would do that. Be honest! How far have you gone?"

"I haven't gone anywhere. Do you know why I was friendly with Dorothy, who I'm not interested in?"

Nade blinked his eyes.

"Huh? You, weren't you interested?"

"I told you, I don't like things that can't be analyzed."

"Then why are you friendly?"

"On the first day of the graduation class schedule, Dorothy had a one-on-one battle with Shirone. Remember what I said then? I said I would do what Shirone wants if I make it a draw."

"Ah."

Iruki raised his finger.

"She's obsessed with rankings and uses conditions and rewards. Besides, if she's a joiner, there are many advantages in Scramble Royale."

Nade finally understood.

"Okay, then Iruki will try to persuade Dorothy... and the last one?"

Iruki asked.

"What about Sabina?"

It was important to have emotional homogeneity to form a team as well as skills.

In that sense, Sabina was an excellent choice.

"That's absolutely not possible."

Nade firmly shook his head.

Victor Sabina, the red dot of Dante's party.

He was a strong man of air magic that fired dozens of air cuts per second, and he had a record of defeating Nade in a two-thousand battle, so his skills were certain.

"Don't just say no and think about it. It seems like she's subtly caring about you. I also decided to persuade Dorothy, and Shirone has to ask a difficult favor."

"No! No! Absolutely not!"

As Nade flapped his limbs and struggled, Shirone sighed and spoke.

"Then what are you going to do? It's not a matter of can or can't. Why are you so unlike yourself?"

Nade wiped his hands with a disgusted look.

"But no! Give me a chance just once. I'll find a helper in time somehow. Sabina is really not possible!"

There was no reason to stop him from saying he didn't want to die.

"Okay. Then Nade will find a helper in time, and Iruki and I will try to persuade Amy and Dorothy."

That's how it was concluded for the time being.

That night, Shirone went to Amy's room.

Considering Amy's skills, there could be no Plan B, so she had to be captured.

'There's no stalking.'

It didn't matter if they were being followed since the enemies had already declared war.

When they knocked on the door, they heard Amy's voice.

"Who is it?"

"It's me, Shiro."

Amy, who came out after opening the door, tilted her head.

She seemed to have just washed up, she was in her pajamas, and her hair was still wet.

"Shiro? What's up all of a sudden?"

Even though she wasn't the type to dress up, the atmosphere was different from what they had seen during the day, just by being in comfortable clothes.

As Shiro looked at her with sparkling eyes, Amy blushed as if she was embarrassed and asked.

"Why are you looking at me like that? You saw me earlier, didn't you?"

Even though her tone was brusque, it wasn't an unpleasant face.

"No, I just thought you look good in your pajamas."

"Phew."

Amy snorted as if she had heard enough.

"It's not for free, what did you come for?"

"Actually... I have a favor to ask."

"Hehe, I knew it. What's the favor?"

Encouraged by the sweet feeling in Amy's voice, Shiro smiled brightly and said.

"This time, supernatural spirit science...."

Bang!

The door closed.

The final negotiation of the Scramble Royal was on this week's holiday.

Shiro and his party, who had to find supporters by then, decided to use their only break time, lunchtime.

Among the candidate supporters, Amy was undoubtedly the key, so Shiro persistently followed her.

However, it was not an easy task to change the mind of her, who was no less stubborn than Shiro.

"Amy, it's really important. You know what kind of place the Supernatural Spirit Science Research Association is."

"...."

"If the history of the research association founded by Miro is cut off in our generation...."

"Ah, really!"

Amy, who couldn't stand it, yelled out loud.

"What do I care? Whether the research association is overturned or overturned! By the way, you, are you really not going to graduate? Did you refuse the evaluation for this?"

"No, I have to graduate...."

Looking at Shiro, who was hanging his head with a gloomy face, Amy twisted her lips.

'Oh, this innocent kid must have been in a hurry....'

The fact that Shiro, who hates to bother others, is clinging like this means that he is really desperate.

And it wasn't bad that she was the target of it.

'But I can't. How can I for a week....'

It was too risky to permit it with just emotions.

Even if she bet on the graduation class ranking, it was not a big merit for Amy, who is ranked 5th in the hierarchy.

Above all, she was worried that she could not fully concentrate on the evaluation during the Scramble Royal period.

Of course, she was asked to participate only when she had time, but she didn't want to be a burden with such half-hearted power.

'If you're going to do it, you have to do it right.'

With the determination to give up graduation.

But when she wondered if this incident was so serious, she still had doubts.

"I got it. I'll think about it. So cheer up. It looks like you're going to collapse."

Shiro's face finally brightened.

"Thank you, Amy."

Nade, who had been listening to the two's conversation, thought.

'It won't be easy, Shiro either.'

And he looked at Iruki, who was eating in front of him, and asked.

"How about you? Is it going well with Dorothy?"

"Yeah. We're going to talk in detail later."

"Oh, you're showing interest?"

"Are you stupid, bring up the main point first? I just said it was about the graduation class ranking, so she has to come."

"You're quite cautious. But how do you think about that? You said you're not interested in women's psychology."

"Because I'm not interested, I can see it coolly. Do you know what the common point of men who can't date is? They want to date too much. Women are full of all kinds of emotions, and they are born with the ability to handle men's emotions. The moment you lose your coolness, you just get eaten."

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

"Who says what? It's okay, Sabina. I have eyes to see too."

"So what's the problem?"

"Ah, Sabina is......"

Nade swallowed his words with a sigh of distress.

'It's about seeing my real face.'
